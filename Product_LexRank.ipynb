I like this one better than the vertical folding one they have ASIN : B000KK5FR8 ( this version I am reviewing , won 't hit your elbow in your coat pocket or slide around ) .Glad I got the last one at least !\", \"Excellant and helpful product . A lot of the Doctors at medical school ordered this clipboard after seeing my son 's .\", \"I like this clipboard very much . It is handy and fits into small spaces so that I don 't have to carry a big bulky regular clipboard around that becomes unwieldy . It has made my work so much easier .\", 'Very nice , I use it everyday at work and I am planning on buying another for home use .', 'Really good but price is a lil moreworks better for those who were white coats but most of the times residentsdonot wear coat but I do so works for me', \"I bought this about a month ago and it has proven really helpful ! The only reasons I didn 't give 5 stars : It does not fit A4 paper ( the European style ) well , and most importantly , it is a little heavy.Other than these , it is almost perfect ! I highly recommend it ( especially for US ) !\", 'Great product , very handy , lightweight.Now I never forget any pertinent things about my pt even at the end of the day , I can write my notes .', 'Handy clipboard that conveniently fits in the side pockets of my whitecoat .

I haven \\'t lost my \" brain \" since I have been using this . It is easy to use and put in my pocket , and then flip out to use when I need it !

I carry one daily and have done so for more than a decade . This is the best one I have found and I love that it fits in my white coat pocket . It is sturdy for me to write on at the bedside as well . I have shown it to everyone .', \"Works very well . I agree with other reviewer that it does have capacity limitations but easily carries what I need for daily rounds . Even if you don 't put it in your coat pocket it is less bulky to carry folded compared obviously to full size clipboard . Pretty expensive though ; I think they would sell many more if they dropped the price .\", 'fits perfectly in your white coat ... these have become quite popular in my institution and for good reason. very handy ! !', \"Love it ! It 's very helpful in the hospital when seeing patients . There 's lots of good information on it .\", 'Great for medical students and interns . Has good information , as you progress from student to resident you need less information since you have memorized it , best for med students .', 'Cute clipboards . Fits in the pocket when folded . I gave it 4 stars only because its a bit pricey .', 'It is very practical idea but it can not hold tons of paper . It is relatively sturdy and the equations on the outside are very helpful .', \"I love this thing . I gave it 4 stars because i prefer the vertical one to the horizontal one just because that 's the way i like to fold my papers , but this thing works great . If i could the the vertical one again i would be super excited . So ...
