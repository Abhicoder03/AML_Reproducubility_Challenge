Additionally, I had removed a tomato slice from my burger because it wasn't quite ripe and I'm not a lover of tomatoes all the time.

Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.

I ordered the same drink, several times. Each time it came, it looked different from the last. They have a dish on the menu with Marcona almonds. They almonds were not Marcona almonds.

There could have been more grits and it would have been more satisfying. The bread pudding was the best I've had at a restaurant. The sauce was great and it came with vanilla bean ice cream on top!

The sugar was fired well ahead of time and the crème itself was very blah--a tasteless custard that was not set correctly. The place is loud on weekends so not for a cozy dinner.

The manager came over and apologized, still left the burger on the table as if he was still going to eat it. She proceeded to bring out a free dessert that we neither asked for, nor really wanted.

The greens were so salty I had to spit it out. The waiters came to our table only twice in the evening.

It was basically an oily, fried piece of fish that lacked flavor except for the heavy dose of salt - that also permeated the accompanying vegetables.

The fries had good flavor, but were super soft which is not my preference for fries.  The Salad Luke was overly dressed so the dressing overpowered any other flavors in the salad.  We also tried the gumbo, which was good, but not fantastic.  \\n\\nI would totally go back for the happy hour and so I will likely try other items on their menu, but I think their oysters is really the only reason to come to this restaurant.\",\n",

There were plenty of people at the restaurant, and again, the food was outstanding, it was just all in the presentation of the feel of the restaurant.

Oysters are 50 cents, cocktails (originally priced under 10) are half off between the hours of 3-6 pm.\\n  The champagne au peche, St. Charles Streetcar cocktails were tasty, but not as stiff as I would have preferred.

His soft shell crabs were greasy and so were the fries that came with it. My burger was over cooked, the cheese was burnt and it was barely edible.

It may not have been that bad, but horseradish was never mentioned in the menu, so it was a surprise and WAY too overwhelming.

      "this place SUCKS. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food. This is my second time with the same results. I gave them the benefit of the doubt -perhaps having an off night the first time I went, but it was the exact same the second time around. Nothing innovative. They churn tables out and could care less that you are spending upwards of $150 for two. Save this one for the tourists. If I were writing this based on my dinner experience, it'd be 4 stars, but we went back for brunch the next day.  Dinner: GREAT happy hour, we had 3 dozen oysters. The place was clean, efficient, and really good. Shawn (female) was on the ball! Pros: Happy hour drink prices. Oysters were divine (I had the P&J) Cons: I ordered the express, which was rabbit sausage with mustard sauce and noodles...mediocre at best.  Breakfast: Service was slow as Hell compared to the night. Everyone around us was getting agitated Pros: Eggs in a jar was so unique I actually took a photo of it. Cons: Menu was tiny, a mimosa special would help this place out. Decent, consistent food. If you're in the CBD, they make solid food for a quick lunch or happy hour. This is only based on breakfast. The selection is limited. I was hoping they'd have beignets. In lieu of that, I got coffee, fruit, and bacon - sweet and salty. The coffee was great. The bacon and fruit were sad for $5 each. The bacon was scrawny. The few berries weren't sweet, and the melons were under ripe. As with the hotel itself, the staff were rather muted - not especially helpful or friendly.  If it's raining outside and you're getting ready to leave, stay here for breakfast. Otherwise, go out. Completely UNDERWHELMED........ Love John Besh, but he wasn't fooling me--that was étouffée sauce on the shrimp and grits!  If I wanted étouffée, I would have order it. Food was okay, but VERY expensive. We had New Year's Eve dinner at Lüke. Two of our party of three ordered the 4-course set menu.  The waiter skipped the second course entirely, and then said it wasn't a course at all when we pointed this out.  We sought clarification and the waiter was indeed wrong and did not understand the set menu.  Another waiter stepped in, offered to serve the second course after the third, and to give us complimentary champagne, more wine, money off our check, and extra food.    The solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the \"champagne\" was horrid, but it was New Year's Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.    Overall, a bit of a disappointment. Just ok. This restaurant was attached to our hotel.   Bread pudding was burnt on top and all of the yummy sauce dripped off before it was served.  The \"bacon onion pizza\" (I cant pronounce the actual name, but we felt \"flamin cootchie\" was a possibility)was supposed to be awesome, but I felt the torte was soggy.   The beet salad was great. Shrimp étouffée  had a good sauce, but small portion.   As mentioned in other reviews, expect to spend some time there because the waitstaff is very nice, but slow.  All in all, there are better places to eat in NOLA. The menu is extremely limited and overpriced. Some of the seating is weird. I would not highly recommend this restaurant. This place was ok, it definitely didn't blow my mind. Well, the brussel sprout appetizer did blow my mind because it was fantastic. The entree, though, did not blow my mind. I went simple and got the burger, it wasn't cooked quite the way I ordered it. Additionally, I had removed a tomato slice from my burger because it wasn't quite ripe and I'm not a lover of tomatoes all the time. A waiter walked over and informed me that I could have asked for the burger without the tomato...uh, duh? I have been to restaurants before. I just wasn't hugely impressed. Our waiter was great, though, and super helpful. John Besh. Brunch. You'd think you'd be in Creole heaven, but the experience was a bit dissatisfying.   I ordered the Friday express, which included a soup or salad and an entree. I forget what it's called but it contained shrimp, oyster and a tiny crab claw. It was okay. Nothing stood out.   After eating the Shrimp and Grits at Cafe Amelia, we were excited to see how others compared. At Luke, you get a sizable portion and it's good but not great.   Overall, there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere. Let me start by saying the oysters are wonderful.  The rest of our meal, not so much.  Our second dish was the Pate of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Livers.  Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.  Our total bill, with a $40 bottle of wine and two cocktails was over $170.  Poor value for inconsistent food. Please note that our server, Chi, was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful. Pretty good food, on the French bistro side of things. Went for dinner, packed on a Monday night. We were seated all the way in the back with a view of the kitchen  The choucroute plate was great, with a huge but tender smoked pork shank, boudin, squares of crispy/melty pork belly, and house made sauerkraut all nestled in a cast iron serving pan. GF had the special, fried pork loin with grits and greens that was tasty but pretty ordinary. Took a WHILE for entrees to arrive, but we left stuffed. Went there this morning for brunch. The waiter was not friendly at all. Had to keep asking for coffee refills...and creamer...and sugar. We were a party of 6 & all 6 of us were drinking coffee. How do you not bring more creamer & sugar? He seemed annoyed that i asked him to repeat the special. He never smiled or even looked at us. The portions were large. Overpriced. I had the burger. It was nothing great. Bisque was good. My son had the crabmeat omlette which he didn't like. My other son had the croquet madam which he liked. We will most likely not go back. We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.  The cocktails, however, were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again, I unfortunately can't comment on the oysters. The only reason they get two stars is that when we mentioned the 2 entrees we ordered were barely lukewarm, they took them off the bill.  Otherwise it would be one star.  We went with another couple, ordered wine and appetizers, which were alright but unremarkable.  All of the staff seemed frazzled and disorganized, stuff kept being dropped all over the place.  After we were served the entrees the waitress didn't check back until we called for the bill.  That's when the other couple and my not-shy wife complained, and the manager came over and apologized and did the right thing.  We ate at another Besh restaurant nearby, Domenica, the night before, and it was outstanding.  Go there instead. My fiancé and I ate breakfast here and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  I had the beignets which were overly sweet and the filling didn't quite work. The fiance had the southern breakfast, said the eggs were cooked poorly and the grits were too salty.  Overall it wasn't terrible, but it was probably the most disappointing meal we had during our four day trip to New Orleans.  We did eat here on a Monday morning so it may have been an off day. While this is technically a German'ish restaurant, it has a lot of options and really seems more rustic French to me.  It's a good choice for a \"nice\" lunch downtown.  The daily specials are usually good.  All of the sandwiches I've tried are great with Croque-monsieur being my favorite.  The brunch is good too but if I'm downtown for brunch I want to go somewhere with live jazz. Hostess staff less than cordial (girl with the 'Sideshow Bob' hair acts like she really doesn't give a Debbie Wasserman Schultz about her job); wait staff mediocre and tried to charge us for something not ordered that a manager gave us to make up for poor performance; foo foo food with a fancy cook's name; waste of expensive space Group of hostesses were not welcoming when we walked In at 8:25pm, we didn't have reservations,  told us we wouldn't be able to sit until 945, I then went on open table and booked one for 8:30pm, oh isnt technology amazing! We were sat at 8:35, the group of 4 women at the front just seemed to want to  be bitchy because we didn't make reservations ahead of time, but the website clearly says walk in welcome. The waiter was nice, I had the luke burger and it was average, the bottom bun was soggy from the grease... fries were cold. However my wife had the shrimp and grits and said it was the best she has ever had. Food was decent. I ordered the chicken with potatoes. The potatoes tasted weird and had like a weird tangy flavor. Chicken was dry and salty. Waiter was charming but bad with filling up water. He would fill one cup up and leave the others empty for no reason. Also had a very small selection. Though, I tried my brothers hamburger and it was outstanding! Children may not like this place but it'll be fine for adults unless you're picky. Being a local, I have to give Luke 3 stars... Ok 3 & 1/2 if I could. I love the atmosphere and the food is pretty good, but I wouldn't ever go out of my way to eat here. I've been several times with high hopes since I'm a Besh fan but haven't ever really been impressed.   I think there are better places in the city where you can get similar food. It's one of the better places in the CBD I suppose, but not city-wide.   To sum it up, food is good but not amazing. And they do have a great happy hour! Simply did not stand up to rating. Very mundane at best. They did offer to substitute some veggies for the less than satisfying potatoes served with roasted chicken. I came here for dinner. The service was okay, she hardly came around to our table.   Beet salads (3/5) - The dressing was delicious with the pecan caramel. However, they need to chop those veggies smaller because when I eat the sauce would get all over my face.  Fried oyster salad (3/5) - The best part is the fried oysters Flammenkuchen (1/5) - Cheesy, salty and sweet....I did not like it at all Cream brulee (4/5)  Overall, it was an okay restaurant. I heard their lunch/brunch menu is much better so I would come back to try their brunch. My expectations were quite high as the place was listed in the \" must visit\" in NOLA.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night. The atmosphere was nice enough. The wait staff friendly but so-so. We were a party of 4. We ordered cocktail, the appetizers. The appetizers came out before the cocktails, which I thought was odd. I ordered the same drink, several times. Each time it came, it looked different from the last. They have a dish on the menu with Marcona almonds. They almonds were not Marcona almonds. Ok, yeah, big deal. But the point is, the menu says one thing, they deliver another.  Not what top tier joints do. Shrimp and grits was very good. Other meals were ok, not stellar.  I think NOLA has many better choices. Limited selection in bar. Was really pumped to try this place Bc John Beche has such a good reputation but it was totally mediocre.  I'm from NYC so have access to excellent food and maybe that's why I found everything to be lacking but generally there wasn't anything j couldn't cook at home myself. Don't bother. I came here tonight with my cousin and best friend, hoping for a great time. We were out celebrating a birthday!  First of all, the service was HORRIBLE. I don't know if it was because they undermined us because we looked young, but it seems as if every table was getting attention BUT us. Not only that, but we sat next to a couple that WOULD NOT STOP ARGUING. Definitely ruined the experience of an upscale dinner.   Second, the food was mediocre. We ordered the shrimp and grits, rotisserie chicken, and ribeye. Everything was overly salted and poorly portioned.  Definitely had higher expectations due to the chef's name attached.    We will NOT be coming back ever. We could totally receive more for what we spent elsewhere. It was definitely an experience. Pictures are posted. It looked better than it tasted. The atmosphere and the restaurant itself was great, but the food was average at best. I had the burger, which I heard was one of the best, and I didn't think it was that special. I have had \"many\" burgers that were tastier than this one. The fries would have been good, but the ones they served me were nothing but crumbs. My wife had the shrimp and grits and she said they were good. So that was a positive. Service was average.   Out of all the places to eat in NOLA, there are better options elsewhere. Food is not worth the price, fills a hole at best. Went there for brunch because of the reviews. Menu had some leftover food on it from last customers. Service was ok, coffee was way too strong and had floating grounds in it. Probably one of our least favourite meals while staying in New Orleans. I was in town for business and too tired to venture out and find something. Since I was staying at the Hilton next door, I decided to go out of convenience. I thought I would keep it simple with a burger and a beer. I'm always a sucker for a good burger!  I'll say that the burger meat itself was cooked to perfection (medium) with some great smokey flavor. However, the accompaniments were not so impressive. The bacon was limp, there was very little cheese, the bun was dry and crumbly, and the fries were barely warm and limp. If they had taken the time to prepare everything properly, it could have been amazing. For an $18 burger, I expect there to be a little more attention to detail. This place is part of the Hilton hotel and way more expensive than the Yelp price range suggests.  Room-service food at room-service prices! A typical refined oyster bar with friendly staff & well portioned dishes. The service however regarding pacing of dishes is off & needs refinement as main courses were brought while we we still working on our appetizers & then we were expected to make room. Overall though a good place to perhaps meet friends. If you like practicing your lip reading skills (noisy) and daydreaming about who on earth trained the wait staff (who can't manage simple things like a water refill when they bring your food and your glass is dry; who can't bother to serve an a la mode dessert with less than completely melted ice cream; who don't warn you that one of the desserts is drastically different from the description on the menu), this is your place.  The mediocrity of the food won't distract you much from that core experience, though the bill might. There are too many great places to eat in New Orleans for LUKE to deliver such uninspired food and inattentive service. It was the only disappointment we had on a great food weekend. Cochon, Butcher and Herbsaint are all nearby and so much better. Luke's only saving grace was the raw bar but even that took way too long to get a platter of oysters out of. The Burger is also good and a safe choice. Luke does the room service for the Hilton. I wouldn't recommend ordering room service. It was below average and I found the gumbo to be very bitter. Out of lager and serving Jagerschnitzel that was way too salty and covered in salad dressing. This is German food? Nein Danke. Portions are appropriate for a German stomach. Went to Luke for happy hour expecting to come away with a smile on my face and a belly full of delicious $0.75 oysters.  Little did I know that retribution would be inflicted upon my bowels for my gluttony and stinginess.  Food poisoning from these oysters ruined my entire Mardi Gras weekend, leaving me starving and sober during one of the most hedonistic festivals in existence.  Perhaps management felt the need to cut costs along with increasing prices by switching to cheaper oysters.  Steer clear of this place until they reevaluate their suppliers. If you want great Oysters this place is a must-do. The restaurant ambiance is Ok and the service is good Not a fan, but I am rather picky. I enjoyed the catfish and the cheese grits are amazing. Interesting atmosphere but extremely noisy. Had breakfast here today. Service is very unattentive and we had to call the waiter multiple times for coffee refil and he also overcharged our check. I had the duck omelete, which was greasy and the waiter also misplaced my toast side order for french fries. For a 30 dollar breakfast I expected much more, would not go back. This place looks a lot nicer than it actually is, unfortunately. It's also priced as if it were a nicer restaurant.  I just ordered soup since I wasn't all that hungry to begin with, and it was just ok. My friend, however, ordered a full entree for $26 and she said it was subpar at best. The fries were soft and the schnitzel didn't have much flavor. It was a $30 fried meal basically. The staff also seemed inexperienced. They were nice though.   I know we didn't have to order what we ordered. Maybe if we had ordered something else, our experience would have been better, but overall we weren't impressed. Worst service I have EVER received, we had alarge party and they were rude from the start!  Ride about our orders, rolling eyes and huffing.  Bearded, shirt skinny server was worse in my life!  Made everyone uncomfortable!  Mentioned to another host? Who came by our table and she was rude too!  Food and drinks may be great at happy hour but not worth the terrible service!  Only place in NOLA that hasn't been hospitable!   Server came back and apologized for his rudeness!  Shocking moves up from 1 to 3, still unhappy he ruined my experience.  Even though we appreciate the apology very much! Average touristy place. When acclaimed chef goes mainstream commercial, it brings below average plates / experience. I went here for breakfast this morning. Service was good. I would say the food is okay for what you get. I ordered the pancakes and a side of bacon. $19 later I was full but neither was out of this world. Maybe I'll see if dinner is bettet Nice place. The service is very friendly & very fast. The best part of our meal was the chocolate pecan tart for dessert.  The food was okay. Not fabulous. And when we ordered we specifically requested our food not come immediately after our starters.. It did. Maybe we were too full to enjoy them, I don't know. But I feel strongly that when a request like that is made... It's not difficult to honor. I was disappointed. We had the Mahi & Wild Boar Ragout, again, average food. The kale with the Mahi was DELISH though. Am in on a quick business trip in New Orleans and checked out this place - mainly because of its proximity to my hotel, but also in part because of the excellent reviews here on Yelp. I ordered a bowl of gumbo and a sazerac, both of which were good but not transcendent. The gumbo, at $10 a bowl, was fairly priced but not what I expected in terms of quality. Probably not the house specialty and probably not what I should have ordred, but c'est la vie.   Everything seemed a little dusty, as well. Just didn't feel all that clean or comfortable.  Would definitely come back, but with a bigger appetite and a wider focus on the menu. Our party of 5 arrived at Luke on a Friday before heading off to Jazzfest. We made a reservation the night before but when we entered the restaurant it too the hostess almost 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing in the lobby. There were 2 other groups waiting there as well.   That beginning wait kind of set the tone for the whole meal. The service was a little slow. The cocktails and food were good. I got the southern breakfast, my friends got the chicken biscuit and shrimp and grits. We all liked our meals.   If you don't mind a wait then stop on into Luke, where the experience is good but I would not go out of the way to stop in here. First meal in NOLA .. Went here cause it was the highest rated place that was open and in walking distance to the hotel.. The Brussels sprouts were awesome.. Definitely get these..  Ordered the shrimp n grits and crab bisque.  Very heavy on the salt.. Overwhelmed the delicate shrimp and crab flavor..  Ordered the Baked oyster .. It had a nice herb flavored in the crust but was over powered by the concentration of butter ..  Yeah, its New Orleans, yeah the food is supposed to be rich and decadent...  But our plates were a bit much.. Are u kidding me? Not only were there 8 tables open when we walked in and they told us a 3 hour wait... We were about to order a drink at the bar when one of the waiters purposely kicked me in the back of the foot when I wasn't looking and tried to play it off like one of their other hostesses did it.  Way many better other options in new orleans We went there after making a reservation for two. The menu does not have a lot of variety and the food is mediocre. I had high hopes but it did not meet my expectations. Service was good overall along with good ambiance. I don't get all the good reviews!?? Everything was way over priced. Waiters snobby. Atmosphere....not casual. Everyone was dressy. The gumbo I got was meh. Shrimp and grits was ok. Nothing great though. Oh and the only refill we got was our water. Coke is in a bottle so I guess I should've expected no refills but on tea? Wasted $80. There are way better places to eat. Seafood restaurant, bill for $155 for 2, prices high, service really slow, food ok but nothing to write home about.  Our table wasn't cleared for 20 m so we moved to bar, and manager checked in with to us.  Offered us a glass of wine, which is nice, but didn't offer a discount.  Not sure I'd recommend.   Editing the review because the manager gave us a appetizer platter off of the bill.  Made us feel better. The food was pretty good but as soon as I walked into a restaurant it smelled like rotten fish. The smell was so bad we asked the hostess to seat us in the back.  I got the Southern Breakfast - $15 - which had two eggs, cane syrup sausage, biscuit and grits. We all wanted the chaMpagne au peche - $9.75 - champagne & fresh peach, but the restaurant ran out of peach.  After our meal, we had to walk back through the nasty fish smell, which then turned my stomach.  For a John Besh Restaurant I was VERY disappointed. The food was just not good enough to match the price.  Very expensive and the food did not particularly wow me.  It was overall OK. This place didn't have anything German on the menu.  The burger was good but not $16 good.  Kind of overpriced for what they had.   It was okay but it is not worth the prices. We came for the oyster happy hour and enjoyed the drinks, but were largely disappointed by the oysters. They were all very dirty and 2 of the 12 raw oysters we received looked like they had been mashed up or chewed and returned to the shell. I'd say they were not worth it even at the happy hour price, but I certainly would not pay full price for this. There are much better oysters in the city (and better oyster happy hours!). Didn't live up to expectations.  We were excited based on all the positive reviews, but Luke sadly didn't pay off.  I started off with a mint julep which tasted like bourbon water. Zero mint or sweetness to it.  For dinner I had the shrimp and grits which was very tasty, but the portion was so small.  It was sized more for an appetizer rather than entree.  When I pay over $20 for a dish it needs to be somewhat filling.  Creme brulee for desert was good.  I would not go back. Waited over 20 minutes for our table even tough we had reservations.  Food wasn't all that. I picked up the rib eye w side of carb meat. Had a beer at the bar while waiting for my food . Super nice bartender. However food is overpriced for the ok quality . 2 ounces of crab should not cost $13. Also when leaving I noticed fresh red drops of a liquid on the white floor , whatever that was . Loved it for Sunday brunch, dinner was hit or miss at our table.  Wasn't impressed with the crawfish bisque, and some entrees can be pretty rich, a la the redfish court boullion.   The craft beers are great, oysters (at least the ones we had) were small and not very impressive. Don't know if this is temporary considering the hit the oyster fishermen took, but we'll see.  I'd say all in all it was a nice dinner, but no real show stoppers. At least on this visit. Made it to Luke's for dinner and the crabmeat ravioli is AMAZING.  However I'm knocking off a star because the place was a zoo.    The next table was a 50th birthday party of 9 adults; one of the women was literally yelling at the top of her voice.  With tile/hardwood floors and tin ceilings, the volume in the restaurant almost ruined our meal.  It was exceedingly difficult to carry on a conversation at our table of 5 in between the shrieks next to us.    Other dishes at our table were the redfish (w/ the crabmeat), the vanilla duck, shrimp & grits, and the shrimp farci.  Everyone thought their food was lovely...if only the atmosphere had been as nice. I was really disappointed in the food here. The gumbo was so bland and the waiter agreed with me. The happy hour deal on oysters was worth it as they were a really good size. I wouldn't spend my time going back here. The fried oysters were way too greasy! This place is pretty good for a couple of things, the Brussel sprouts and the cooked oysters. I've tried many other main courses that just didn't wow me and took off stars for that. Service was good at least! My colleague and I ate here after attending a nurse practitioner conference. We had heard amazing reviews about this restaurant and were excited to experience a taste of New Orleans. We arrived at the restaurant and were informed it would be a two hour wait to be seated, though there were plenty of open tables. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, and assumed they were reserved. We took a seat at the bar, where we were helped by an amazing bartender who also seemed confused that we weren't able to get a seat. After speaking with some coworkers, the hostess was able to get us seated in the mostly empty restaurant. Our waitress was rude and blamed us for moving a water flask we never touched. Food was decent. But overall a bad and strange experience. Positives:  We had the gumbo and fresh gulf fish--excellent.  The veggies were perfectly cooked (my wife still can't stop talking about the brussel sprouts).  Negatives: The waitress was in a bad mood and my seat was right under the A/C vent.  I got so cold, I sat on the bench seat by my wife and another diner.  Food:  5 stars Service: 1 star Not happy with the changes to the menu. I miss the Choucroute Garnie and the escargots. I also loved having the option of ordering just the rillettes, but now you can only get the whole charcuterie plate. This was my second time visiting this place and while the food was good, I thought it wasn't good enough to warrant coming back here yet again, especially since this is quite a pricey place. As I sit here at the bar desperately trying to get my waitress attention  I can't help but think back to a time when Luke had really great service. I love this restaurant. The food never disappoints . I have been here countless times.  But the service is to be desired. Ive had cocky waitress's, who love to talk over you when asking a question to next to little attention at times at the bar. And no not during happy hour either. Mr. Besh you need to spend some time there. Happy hour review only. I had a sazarac at pretty much every bar I went to in NOLA, and this one, while very good, doesn't rank anywhere close to the top. However, the price was absolutely unbeatable...I didn't think it was possible to get a sazarac for under $5!  We also split a dozen of the happy hour oysters, and really, all I can say is that they were worth the $.50 each. I've had better oysters in DC, and way better oysters in New Orleans. I'm guessing the non-happy hour ones were higher quality, and I think next time I'd pay a bit more money to get better ones. Ultimately, everything we had was pretty good, but with so many excellent restaurants nearby, I'm not sure I'd make it back. Came here for lunch. The service was good but the food was underwhelming, especially for the price.  Ordered the... 1/2 dozen stuffed PJ oyster ($19) Croque Madame with fries ($15)  The oysters were stuffed and broiled over a shrimp and crab mix. They were very salty and had very little flavor.  The Croque Madame is two pieces of bread with ham covered in cheese with an egg on top. This dish was also very salty with little flavor. The Croque Madame along with the fries was cold. The coffee and bentons bacon was good, but I wouldn't order the frittata again, under cooked so runny in the middle, too much caramelized onion and the dressing on the arugula was pouring off the plate. Made for a soggy mess. Great deal for happy hour -- fifty cent raw oysters, one dollar fried oysters, 50% off drinks.  Unfortunately, other than the oysters and drinks we were a little disappointed. The Etoufee was moderately tasty but very small for the prince, the complementary bread was frankly inexcusably stale and un-appetizing and the foie gras terrine was on the edge of frozen when it came out.  Come for the happy hour drinks and oysters but skip the rest. We wanted to like the Flamenkuchen, but just didn't.  Those big pieces of ham/bacon with all that fat was just too much.  And we encountered the most arrogant server, Kenneth, that we have ever had.  After the first course, we decided to cut our loss and not stay for anything else.  We expected so much more from a Besh restaurant. I've been twice for lunch and disappointed each time. The food is fine but in this city fine does not cut it. The service was down right bad the 2nd visit. We dined at Luke for Christmas dinner 2016.  This is a busy, hectic restaurant and does not bode well for a relaxing atmosphere.  In addition, the layout is a long galley so the servers are carefully navigating the space to not bump into each other or customers.  The lighting was bright, not what we were expecting.  We spoke with the manager that night, a woman named Tea who was really great and you could tell that she was the glue keeping the operation together.  Food was good, but I wasn't blown away.  It's tough to stand out in a city with so many great options. Worst service! Told the hostess we wanted to sit in the bar area and she insists on sitting us in the back of the restaurant which is empty. Sat there for over 10mins with tons of staff walking by & just staring at us but no service, not even water. We finally got fed up and walked out. Horrible! I give this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars. The service was great. Had some locals that worked there tell us what was good on the menu. I got the shrimp and grits which was delicious but it wasn't enough. The fresh baked bread was good too! We also got gumbo for an appetizer and I bit into something very hard which made me stop eating because I didn't want to lose a tooth. The bread pudding was not good but I was able to return it for the cake with blueberry sauce which was very good. My boyfriend got the stuffed shrimp and peach cobbler. The shrimp  was good but the peach cobbler was not the best I ever had. Overall this was a nice place with great service unwound go again to try something else on the menu. We were on vacation and staying at the Hilton located within the same building.  The hotel recommended the restaurant for dinner after our arrival.  We found the staff to be unfriendly, cold and a little snobbish.  They had people walking in to seat and told \"us\" it would be a 2 hr wait, when we could clearly see seats available. at least 4 tables in the main dining and several in a back dining area.  We felt discriminated against because we were not dressed in a suit and tie or dress.  We didn't wait! Luke is in the Hilton New Orleans.  It was late, raining, so stopped in for dinner.  I was impressed by the number of people that came in that weren't staying at the hotel.  The service was good, food was okay - but not particularly special.  Breakfast was better than dinner. $5.75 for a Shiner or $8.5 for a Stella Artois... WHAT? That is not a good beginning in a restaurant when you see the menu. Finally, I order a coke, and the small one was $3 (no refill). About the food, I need to say that was one of the best gumbo I've never had. I also try a kind of big sandwich with smoke ham, that was just good, and shrimps and grits, so-so. I really liked the decoration of the place, but the service wasn't that good. We needed to wait for a while for our meal. Overall, kind of disappointed. Eh. Tasty food but careless, amateur service. I've honestly never seen a wait staff not give a shit about service as I saw at my meal at Luke. Randomly distributing plates as they came our of the kitchen with no apparent thought to having apps out before entrees.  Literally they stacked the tiny table full of appetizers and entrees all at once with no acknowledgement seemingly that fine dining establishments don't do that. Saved only by tasty food. We went here for brunch before the parades while visiting New Orleans Feb. 2014. We didn't have a reservation, but they did seat us. It is loud and was very cold. My husband decided to order the hamburger. It was a $16 hamburger, so he thought it should be spectacular. He said it was just okay. I decided on the steak. I ordered it medium. First time they brought it out, it could moo. I asked to have it recooked. When it was brought back, it was tough and flavorless. I have to say the fries were great and the weight staff was wonderful. But I would definitely not go back there. We tried Luke for dinner since we'd heard good things. My friends ordered the burger and the shrimp & grits. The burger was pretty good -- it was similar to fathers office in LA but the bun wasn't as crunchy/crispy and it didn't have blue cheese. The portions are huge! The shrimp were super juicy and the steak was also quite tasty but came out a bit rarer than I asked for.   Our waiter was awesome -  very personable and friendly. I want to give this place 3.5 stars, because although the food was good, it wasn't a wonder to behold, which is what I had been expecting after all the hype. Nice place. Food was decadent but pricey. Probably cause it's connected to a high-end hotel. The crawfish bisque was delicious but super-rich. Kinda upset my stomach cause I'm not used to such fatty foods.   The service was decent albeit not terribly quick. They sat me in the very back of the restaurant even though it was fairly empty. I dunno why but found that odd. **3.5 stars**  Another John Besh restaurant with a European bistro flair, both in ambiance and food.  I visited this place under the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, and I ended up enjoying myself.  The shrimp \"en cocotte\" was well- cooked (with the most perfect McEwan and Sons grits of course).  The husband's jagerschnitzel was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste to it (I noticed ham bits - is that tasso?).  His meal included a soup and a dessert, which was a steal for $23.  The seafood gumbo tasted alright though the rice tasted old and dry. The profiteroles were a nice touch even when we were all stuffed by the end of the meal.    European with a Cajun flair - not too shabby a place.  I'm glad I tried this place but there wasn't anything that wowed me from this place. Lüke will only receive a three star this time. Although the restaurant look very nice the service was just okay. The hostess was not very friendly. The bartenders were not very friendly when ordering a glass of wine for my girlfriend. Our waiter was actually pretty nice, he did say sorry a lot. Now about the food. For appetizer we ordered was the rabbit- liver pâté which was actually very good. The steak was okay. Nothing to write home about. The crab bisque was fantastic.   There now you know. Go to Lüke and enjoy their .50 oysters and half-off drinks!    Having said that, the service at Lüke was less than sub-par.  Maybe the restaurant is understaffed or the staffs just don't care enough, but we sat next to dirty table for at least 30 minutes.  What blew my mind was how the waiter who was responsible for attending the table went to get the tip left by the previous diners and left the dirty dishes sitting there. The Corn Crab Bisque was thin, everything in it was over-soft as if it had been sitting too hot too long. The Cochon pork was good, moist and tasty. The sausage was smoky but otherwise rubbery and forgettable. I had the bread pudding which came in a ramekin,  was at least 24 hours since it had been put together. It was nuked, the exterior was as hard as granite and the interior was cold. Yuck. Maybe I made a mistake ordering the special but I was mostly disappointed.  The service was good (it was a Tuesday night) and the bar served a good martini. Eek! Methinks not could not be more accurate! This place was not good!   The positive: they were able to seat us quickly and accommodate merging our two groups with two different reservations   The negative: the drinks were expensive, the food was salty (I sent mine back it was so bad, and I never do that and I am a salt lover!), some of it was cold and it was not worth the price we paid. Not to mention the rather slow service. The server tried to be really nice, but it often came off as weird (lots of laughing at his own jokes)   Find a better place to eat, you won't be sorry! Luke was a go to for years. But my past two trips have been underwhelming. Appetizers forgotten, Oysters juices dumped in our guests purse by a waiter, shouting an cursing coming from the kitchen and less the courteous staff has removed Luke from my list. I always enjoyed the raw bar, mussels and fries when I did go. Brunch was fair.  Nothing was particularly offensive, but the overall quality didn't feel consistent with John Besh.  FYI, I'd avoid the crab BLT.  Between the real brioche bread, mayo, thick-cut bacon, deep fried crab and french fries, sometimes too much of something is just too much. I dig the feel of this place--  old school new york subway station meets  fancy southern restaurant.  However, the meal didn't live up to the setting.  The oysters were outstanding, but the prepared dishes felt short (meh on the salad and the shrimp). Also, the service was painfully slow. they love salt in New Orleans.  another restaurant where the flavor was good but overly salty.  plus a place like this should have fresh fries but ours came out cold soggy.  so tried the famous shrimp and grits, rich heavy sauce, nice sausage but too salty.  also shared the seafood platter medium which had a nice assortment of crabs (2 types), clam, oysters (weren't sandy), mussels. Came here for brunch on Saturday. Shrimp and Grits are the best thing here, definitely will come back for it. Stuffed French toast wasn't really my thing, because it was dunked in whip cream and drowned with strawberry syrup. Really loud and busy place, set a reservation so you don't have to wait. Don't put too much heart into this review, as I only had a soup and salad, but....  Table bread was stale, Matzo Ball in my soup was ice cold in the center...The bacon in my salad had a delicious smoke flavor, but was waaaaaay over salted.   Im giving 2 stars for cleanliness and nice attentive and friendly staff. No need to go by and try more things. I'll just hit up Cochon next time I'm in town. Good food at a price. Went here with our daughter and had great drinks.  The sazerac cocktails were excellent as were the Brussel sprouts. The shrimp etouffee and hamburger were good but not screaming great. Service was professional but not the normal NOLA friendly. Overall I would go back but there are better less expensive restaurants in NOLA with warmer service (Elizabeth's and Jacques-Imo's). went for happy hour last week. the 75 cent raw oysters were great- just a shame that they came to our table after our entrees and after we had to ask what  happened to our order. sour disposition by the hostess and not very good service overall. Had the burger with fries, and the fries cooked in duck fat are as good as it gets though. Went to Lukes lastnight for a home cooked meal and this is not the place for that. No sweet tea, lemonade, sweet potato pie, jambalaya, or anything fried. Come here for an elegant, sit down dinner. The menu consisted of about 6 entrees, extremely limited. I had the shrimp and grits and they were just okay. We went at prime brunch time on a Friday and the place was pretty empty which should have tipped us off. The service was good but I wouldn't make it a point to come back here. Menu looked interesting so decided to go for lunch. Service prompt and friendly. Ordered seafood gumbo, was excellent. Also had fried oyster salad. Oysters over fried, hard and crunchy with too many chunks of smoked bacon in the salad. Person next to me also had ordered the same salad, oysters were not over fried. Portion size good. I have been to LUKE four times and this was my worst experience.  There was a hair in my Crawfish Bisque so I quietly brought it to the bartender's attention.  She quickly removed the cup of soup and came back with a manager.  This is where I became disappointed.  The manager could not look me in my eyes and she never said, \"I'm sorry\" for the haor in my food.  She stated that it never should have happened (I agree) and she hopes I will eat there again.  She told me about the three new desserts and offered to give me a complimentary dessert or a new cup of soup.  Sometimes all you need to do is say, \"I'm sorry this happened.\"  I hope there's some additional training on how to talk to customers and resolve issues in a professional manner in the future.  Otherwise, I love eating here! Wanted to eat here, tried to eat here, reservations are merely a stab at a time you may be seated and expect the curly haired blonde at the desk to treat you poorly.  We had a handicapped person in our party and even after asking for a chair for her 2x we were ignored.  No worries, thanks in part to the poor service we found The Pelican Club which we enjoyed immensely. Luke's has been a go to in NoLa for the past ten years. It reminds me of a Parisian brasserie and is centrally located in the central business district. Our last visit to Luke's was fair. The service was excellent as always but the food seemed rather uninspired. We had their house gumbo along with fresh and fried oysters, but the other menu items, I cannot even recall days later. Luke's a place you can stop in for a burger and a beer - or oysters and a cocktail. The food's solid and the atmosphere upscale. Disappointing.  Service mediocre.  Food okay.  Had the signature dish, highly recommended by waiter, of shrimp and grits.  Friend had the omelet.   Okay, but not fine dining by far.  Only time I have not rated a John Besh restaurant highly. Oysters are good especially if you're there during happy hour ($0.75 a pop). Burger was not great ($16.50), cold bun which was too large for the patty and iceberg lettuce.   Jalapeno grits were good but definitely share as it is quite rich. Shrimp chowder was delicious.  Our server personally was pretty rude. Other staff were very polite but I suppose everyone has their good days and bad days. this was a good last minute brunch find for us. we miscalculated timing of when we needed to leave for the airport given saints traffic, so we bailed on our reservation and headed around the corner to Luke's.   Server was very nice and the brunch menu had several appealing options. i enjoyed my shrimp and grits though could have used a larger portion (maybe it was just bc we had eaten nonstop during our trip and my appetite was extra big). i ordered a glass of prosecco that was just ok and my friends both said their bloody mary was just ok as well.   overall was a good, quick brunch stop near our hotel before leaving town. Probably would give 3.5 stars, but settled on 3. Best part is the price of the oysters, you can't beat 50 cent oysters during happy hour. Drinks were ok, but nothing special While I realize the importance of seating people with reservations first, why is it such a fuss to get a table when so many are vacant--both at lunch and dinner? I had the buillabaisse and the gumbo. Both were rich in consistently if under-spiced. I also find seafood in New Orleans -/ certainly here -- to taste a bit muddy. Is it fresh? The fresh bread is warm and crispy, served with whipped butter and replenished as needed. The caramel pecan bread pudding was incredible. Service was quite attentive. A very nice Bordeaux was only $44. Again, front desk is a bit off: I wanted to get a burger and sit at the bar and it seemed a big production to determine that only a very small and awkward side spot was available. The ambiance of Luke is wonderful. The staff is on point as well. The food, well that's a different story. For starters I had the matzo ball soup which was pretty bland and didn't have nearly enough broth for the two matzoh that were provided. My main course, shrimp and grits was terrible. The shrimp were without a doubt frozen. The consistency of the grits were yet to be desired; very clumpy and lumpy. I have been to \"hole in the wall\" places with way tastier shrimp and grits. I'll never be back again as both tables beside me were also very disappointed in their dining experience as well. Sorry Luke but you need to pick up the slack and revamp your menu. We had breakfast at Luke.  The restaurant opened at 7 am, but the staff was definitely not prepared for patrons from the Hilton next door.  We were promptly seated by the hostess, but we waited on coffee for 15 mins.  We placed our order and waited another 20 mins for yogurt/granola breakfast.  It wasn't very busy with two waiters taking orders.  The bartender was refilling his bar but not helping the waiters either.   Food was okay, but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant due to very poor service. This is an okay place to eat.  VERY noisy.  The food is only okay - it's not special and is very forgettable.  It's fine - it's just not wonderful and memorable.  Service is okay.  It's FREEZING cold along the edges of the wall.  There is nothing special about this place at all. I personally cannot recommend it. Second time I visited this restaurant,   Food:  5 stars.  I ordered the salmon dinner with sauteed local vegetables.  Superb.  Service:  1 star.  Overtly rude, slow, simply awful.  Yet, I'd go there again only because they are open late and we came from the airport. Hostess a tad rude, shrimp over cooked. Otherwise the bar tender was great!  Oysters are tasty My Boyfriend's food was spicy to the point of being inedible. Mine was so bland it tasted like nothing.  Quite frankly after this and NOLA and I realized that I will not go to any more \"celebrity\" chef restaurants. Once they make a name they seem to stop trying, maybe the rest of us should stop going.   PS. The bread pudding was fantastic (as boyfriend points out). So we alter the recommendation and say go for dessert, skip the savory. Okay let's just say it was an odd menu.  But maybe not for New Orleans.  Prices are extreme.  A $19 burger?  It was good but it was still a burger.  My husband had a $15 BLT.  It had 2 small whole fried crabs in it.   My diet coke was a laugh.  They must have had to really search to find bottles that small.  an 8 oz bottle, Just got off a cruise and really wanted a soda.  Okay so maybe I was just out of my comfort zone with this place but not impressed.  A big fat zero on service as well had to wait about 40 minutes for our food.  Waitress was sweet but it was just to long a wait. Went for brunch on a Saturday. They offered us the \"breakfast\" menu-about 3 things on that menu. Ok-maybe 5, but certainly no more than 5. The couple that sat next to us 3 minutes after we ordered received an \"expanded\" brunch menu. Annoying. I ordered an omlet with crab, and my husband ordered eggs and meat. The coffee was delish-but they didn't give us hot milk as with the first. The eggs were cold. I mean COLD. The fries that came with my omlet were well seasoned but COLD. Everything was cold. And the final bill for two breakfasts with coffee and nothing more-$48. Extremely disappointed. Food was so so.. Split some apps with coworkers, Brussels sprouts were good... We were not aware there were not free refills on fountain drinks and rang up a $20 bill on club soda, very annoying.  We were also freezing the whole time Staff was friendly enough but the food was just so over the top rich and $50 for breakfast for two at the bar with no alcohol was very expensive. We probably should have just went elsewhere after studying the menu because there really were no healthy options at all. Eggs, crab and a side of greens could certainty be a healthy meal but I think it was all rinsed in butter before it was served. Not for me, thank you. We were staying at the Hilton with a group of people. We decided to go down to the bar to have an appetizer and drinks prior to dinner. After hanging out for a couple hours spending around $700 for our group of 10-12 people, the manager approached us to tell us we needed to conduct business there or leave. What in the actual? In my town that's real money. My husband was so pissed he wrote on the check, thank your manager for the tip. In 15 years, I have never seen him not leave a tip. She then had the gall to come berate us for not tipping. Btw, while our server was polite he was not very attentive. For the remainder of the trip, we walked directly across the street to the Intercontinental bar and had great food and service without anyone busting our chops. This place is good/decent. Before visiting New Orleans, I contacted a few friends for food recommendations and this place came up a couple of times. I would say it was good, but it didn't meet my expectations. The waiter highly recommended the shrimp and grits, but it wasn't great. I had other shrimp and grits at other restaurants over the course of the weekend that were much better and more flavorful. The gnocchi appetizer was very good, and probably the highlight of the meal. My sister got the crispy rice duck confit plate, which was also okay but not great. If I was a local, I would probably go here again but if I was just visiting and in town for only a few days I would go to other places first. The service was very good. Lousiana rabbit terrine was dope.   Fried oyster salad w/ thick cut bacon - amazeballs.  Shrimp and grits - too much hype, disappointing. My shrimp was mealy...  Good but not great. Coffee was quite good. The French country decor was cool. however,  limited menu, sausage a little sweet, service a tad slow even when the place was not that busy. This is a Cajun restaurant, NOT a French restaurant!  The food is so so.  Happy hour drink is $5.  The restaurant is next to Hilton and very close to JW Marriott, Sorry. I was hoping this was going to be good. The food is just OK but worst of all is the service. The server and the hostess and another woman just stand at the front podium and giggling and don't pay any attention to the customers. Zero attention to detail.  Um, I'm here paying your salary...and tip!  But I guess you don't need the tip or the patronage.  Not recommended. The food was excellent, but my only complaint was the service. I feel like we were shuffled among three different waiters and neither of were communicating with each other. We ended up with three servings of bread rolls and one set of utensils because each waiter kept thinking the other was going to bring a spoon. As I said, other than the service, the food was great. I had the chicken, and it was a nice apportion and tasty. Had a reservation on a Wednesday night for 9pm and the place closed at 11pm. Hostess was nice enough, but once we were sat no one greeted us, or acknowledge we were even there. The tables were dirty and the seats were full of bread crumbs. We ended up leaving after 5 min and know one knew. Hope this was a once off deal. Gone downhill since my last visit. Customers dressed like they were at McDonald's. Waiter had no knowledge of wines (could not even pronounce them) and took no effort or time to explain the menu. Servers, whose uniforms didn't fit, seemed bored and unhappy as they slid plates across tables, truckstop style, again taking no time to explain what dish was being served. My wife's pasta was cold. My fish was tasteless and dry lying over uncooked, inedible vegetables. Waiter appeared annoyed when we were honest about the quality of the food. Manager said he would \"take care of it,\" which usually means some sort of comp, but not here. Poor service, we were seated and waited for at least 15 minutes before even being acknowledged. When someone came to the table they assumed we already ordered drinks - we informed the server he was the first person we had come to our table. Our waiter finally arrived and was unhelpful when asked questions about the menu. Very lackluster all together, wish it was all that we were told it would be....:( I was really excited to try this place after reading all of the stellar reviews. Unfortunately the shrimp tasted like ammonia. The grits were excellent, but that shrimp shouldn't have been served... especially not to people who have lived on the gulf coast their whole lives. My fiancé had the schnitzel, and that was alright. It was weird that it was served with a mountain of fries though. A side of greens would've been a lot better rather than fried food on top of fried food. He did enjoy the mushroom ragu that came with it though. And the pecan bourbon tart was excellent. Oh well. Went for brunch today. Had eggs in purgatory. Mediocre. Eggs over cooked. Service was ok. Not impressed. No high standards. Commercially average. Suggestion to check dishes before they leave the kitchen. Found this place on Yelp and was the first place we ate at after we landed in New Orleans. Luckily we made it for their happy hour. We ordered 2 dozens of raw oysters, it was big but wasn't very tasty. I guess we're just used to the oysters from the east coast where you can taste the sweetness in the oysters. Their fried oysters were surprisingly good, and we normally like our oysters raw. The crawfish bisque was also a hit. I normally don't like thick creamy soup, but this was delicious with the bread! Great oyster half shells.   Went there for lunch had the Thursday special lunch.  Jambalaya was ok just a bit too much of pork for my taste Ordered a dozen oyster half shells and waited for awhile  It turned out my server forgot to order and left.  The server who had us after my first server left was quite nice.  We had to order a half dozen cause we had to head out to the airport.  Food were nice and the oysters were great.   Wanted to try more but couldn't.  By far the worst service i have experienced in New Orleans.  I was disappointed But i will give it a try again next time i come.   Hopefully, i will have better experience Gotta say this last time as a bust.. We come to NOLA once a year and have eaten here each visit. This time though nothing worked. The food was cold, the wait staff was not attentive and the overall experience poor. We were greeted by a ho-hum hostess and a waiter in a dirty jacket who stuck his elbow in my wife's face as he poured my coffee.  Don't get the eggs in a jar as they have goopy texture problem. Dry tough sausage and watery chocolate for the beignets provided the finishing touches to a perfect breakfast!  Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Luke is okay. The food was too fishy for my liking. We ordered the blue crab salad (returned it) gumbo, and jambalaya.  The customer service was really good although we did not know who our sole server was, we had at least 4 people come to our table.   The bread pudding was the bomb! Service was fine but the food was a great disappointment. Ordered the shrimp etoufee but it was really pasta etoufe. 5 small shrimp and a lot of pasta. I'd expect this in New Mexico but not New Orleans. Manager said that's the order but didn't charge me. I didn't want no charge, I just wanted a good meal While the food was excellent the service and prices left something to be desired for me.  I was seated underneath a particularly cold air conditioning vent and when I asked them to turn down the air I was told \"that's just the way it is\".  The food was a little on the expensive side for what it was, but i'd still recommend this spot if you're in the area. I've been to the one is San Antonio and I thought I would give this one in New Orleans a try.  Needless to say, in both places they ruined my order.  I'm never going to another Luke's!  Food was ok. Service sucks! Food is good, waiter not!.  Their wines by the glass are overpriced! So I ordered a Sauvignon blanc for $12... Bill arrives and was charged $14. I asked the waiter if he would double check for me. He brings me a menu with the $12 printed as I had seen and proceeded to tell me that it was a misprint and that the wine was indeed $14! Wow, that took some nerve, really? So, I deducted two bucks from his tip. Ambience perfect Staff needs improvement  Location perfect Cocktails delicious German starter surprisingly good  Food ... well this is the kind of place you pay 25 dls for a salad and when you specify no bacon because you have an allergic reaction to it an they bring bacon on it because kitchen forgot or waiter forgot who knows but makes  you think is it worth paying 25 dls for the salad and after you request for a fresh salad because you think they will do a fresh salad with no bacon and they only remove the bacon and you find a piece of bacon  again !! ... is it worth paying 25 dls for this salad?  No!!  I loved the place but imagine they missed this huge detail and I will end up in a the hospital not worth it !! Very disappointing. The waiter seemed rushed. He didn't answer my questions about what i ordered correctly, so i ended up not getting what i was expecting. Our lattes were luke warm. No pun intended. As well as the food. It came out very quickly and my friends croque monseiur was not even melted in the middle. I got baked or fried kale when i was expecting wilted. The server asked my friend (as she was putting food in her mouth) if she was all done eating and did she need a box?!?!?!?? Not what i expected from JB. Think ill steer clear of celebrity chefs from now on... I really want to like this place more than I do. The host staff could be nicer but I get the impression that they're so busy they don't really care if they're welcoming or not. I've had better experiences during lunch in general then happy hour or dinner. The bar area is not separated by much from the dining area and so if you're seated at the bar you tend to get jostled a lot from behind when it's full. That's a real turn off for me. Food's tasty, staff a little cold in general. Oysters are a good happy hour deal by local standards and excellent when compared to Florida and other cities. The bisque is one of the best I've ever had. The beer is definitely worth a try, if you're interested. Had two very well behaved kids with us and they said they wouldn't have a seat for 1 hr when it was evident there was plenty of seating available. They could have just told us kids aren't welcome. Hostess even fumbled around with the lie Ehhh... At least for lunch. Étouffée was ok if you live in Wyoming. Value and cost are not commensurate... Not even close. Go to a diff John  Besh (like Borgne near the Hyatt Regency)... Had the crawfish bisque: a little grainy, but good. The burger: really good, but the default prep is with bacon so if that's not your thing you gotta tell them. The bread pudding: nice, but a little TOO sweet. Also had their house-brewed lager which was very good, but a little \"fizzy\" for my taste.   As others have noted, service was a little slow on a Thursday at 7:30pm. Flipside to that: waitstaff won't bug you too much.  Price was just right too. If I get a chance while here in town, I'll make a return trip. If I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would. We visited this place on a whim for brunch and were not disappointed. The food is good and this seems like it would be a pretty classy place for dinner or happy hour. My only complaint is how pricey it is and maybe I just don't fit the lifestyle this place is catering for. I really enjoyed the food and while we sat at the bar, the bartender was very attentive. The cocktails were fantastic. I'd have drank many more French 75's if only I could have. The food was good, but it didn't knock my socks off. I'd come again for lunch, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice. I would come again for drinks any time. First place we walked into upon arriving to the city...right outside our hotel. Greeting ladies seemed flustered that we did not have reservations at 3:30 on a Thursday???  Anyway, although there seemed to be plenty of available tables...they told us it would be a 1hr 45 min wait?!? Didn't make sense...got the vibe if we would have dressed a little nicer we would have been treated differently, just my impression.   We were told we could go to the Bar...which was over crowded...seems the thing here is to send everyone to the bar while the tables sit empty??! Weird  Don't even want to give them a second chance, too many other warm and friendly place close by! Went here for brunch and thought the food was just okay.  Had the shrimp and grits - $24 for five shrimp and an appetizer-sized portion of grits.  Food was a bit over-seasoned as well.  Left hungry and disappointed.  Maybe dinner is better?  Service was subpar for the type of place this is - it wasn't particularly busy but waited about 5 minutes after finishing our food before the waiter came by to even  check if we wanted a coffee refill.  So much for southern hospitality... Overall had a good experience.  Being a top chef fanatic it was nice to hit a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night.  Initially told there were no tables for 1-2 hours. Then while discussing where else we were going to go... poof!  They magically found a table.  That was nice  I had had a big lunch so didn't order an appetizer (rare for me!) For my entree i had the fish of the day meuniere style. with roasted veggies and spaetzle.  It was satisfying.  Felt like i could get something similar at a million NY restaurants though.  Nothing particularly N'awlins about it.  My mother had the roast chicken with veggies and french fries.  The juices from the chicken were soo tasty i kept dipping fries in it.  I guess i liked her dish better than mine!  A solid meal... It's okay.  Kind of cold and not very welcoming. Loud!  no soft surfaces to absorb noise. The burger that everyone loves was really nothing special. Hey, I'm allergic to onions (yeah, that stinks) so they bring me a burger without the grilled onions BUT IT WAS ON AN ONION ROLL!!! Maybe they were trying to kill me.... anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Luke. no matter how they spell it. The wait for a larger group on Sunday night was ~a half hour. Service was super meh. The waitress interrupted our conversation so many times for unnecessary reasons and it felt so intrusive. We were also rushed so much to finish quickly (even though the entire wait for a table was because two tables had paid already and weren't being rushed to leave...). Even though I asked for the remainder of my food to be boxed, it ended up being thrown away, which I found to be a strange miscommunication...  However, the food was not bad. I didn't like the Brussels sprouts (14$) -- too salty and overcooked, and they were billed as crispy, which they weren't really. I did like my entree, the fried oyster salad (17$) a lot. The oysters were crispy and tasty, and the greens were quite good. The service was brusque and by far the least friendly of the places we ate at, but the happy hour was still pretty good - the fried oysters were our favorite, hot out of the fryer and crispy and the oysters pretty plump at $1.25 per. The raw were also good, and at only 75 cents, a bargoon. The cocktails were strong and also good - the blackberry smash was my favorite, a bourbon based drink, and the ponchat cooler.   Pretty popular place for HH so I think people fill it up near 3, and then there's a lull by 4:30 or so as the first wave stumbles back (to the office?). I got the shrimp n grits and although it was very good, I could only eat one shrimp because of the gumbo and beignets I had an hour prior. I assumed since I had only eaten one bite and explained to the waiter it was delicious but I had eaten right before, he would box it up. As I sat there for long enough I realized he wasn't going to bring it. The waiter apologized and said he'd make me another full order for the inconvenience. Unfortunately when I came home, I found that he had not given me a full order but only 3 shrimp (out of a total of 5 that come with a full meal). Very disappointing. The raw oysters were great! The creole gumbo was okay, my Bloody Mary was blah. It was a long ways away from the Bloody Mary I had this morning at Ruby Slipper.... which was amazing. Although Luke is conveniently located in my hotel, I think I may need to venture out for the remainder of my trip. Go here for the raw bar and only if you have the patience of a saint. The food here is mediocre. Over salted and over done. The bread pudding tastes like citrus, the rabbit sausage pasta has too much going on, everything is fatty and salty instead of flavorful. Service is awful. I once had a waiter spill soup all over me and they didnt even offer to reimburse me for my dry cleaning. John Besh needs to get his act together. Less time trying to be a celebrity and more time making sure his restaurants up to par. Jumbo shrimp and grits dish was amazing! Nice and spicy. The Gumbo was too bland for me even after adding loads of Tabasco to try and spice it up. The P&J oysters were creamy and delicious. I give it a 3 star because the service was subpar. Server literally came zero times after delivering our food to the table and it wasn't even busy at all. 1st time....4 stars 2nd time....3 stars Last time....1 star!!!  I wouldn't go back except for the happy hour oysters.  In fact, the oysters are the only consistently good thing on the menu....and you don't even have to cook them.  It has been really salty the last two trips and it's not worth the cost.  While not as expensive as New Orleans can get, overall not worth the trip. I don't really have ANYTHING nice to say, so I'm tempted to say nothing at all... But in the spirit of helping others I will say that our service and food was poor... in fact my partner was served a salad with rotten lettuce pieces and a brown avocado. Upon sending it back because who'd eat that (especially for what they are charging...) The waiter snatched the plate off the table and didn't say a word. I realize he didn't make the salad and technically he's not responsible for it but his reaction was a little unreal... My $21 crab app was meh... so we didn't even bother to order mains and left. I'm so confused by all of the reviews raving about this place. In a word? OVERRATED. Great late night place ,you get lost in it.  Food service this quality just expect a little bit more . We ate dinner here on Wednesday night.  We started with the crabmeat au gratin and Brussel sprouts - both of which were very good.  To be honest, I am not a fan of Brussel sprouts but our friend was and I tried her's.  They were so good I would order them on my own next time.  My spouse and I each got the Luke burger and fries.  Our friend got the chicken.  They were ok, not good not bad just ok.  For desert we shared the bread pudding and cheesecake.  The bread pudding was outstanding and the cheesecake was good.  The restaurant got more and more throughout the evening.  By the end it was so hard to hear each other we just stopped talking.  The food was pretty good but the noise level was so high it was hard to really enjoy yourself. Limited menu which changes. Be sure to check in advance if you want a specific dish.  Great escargot  Limited pours on drinks I'm a big John Besh fan.  But I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this restaurant.  Our seats were in a very busy spot with lots of passing traffic. If we had known we would have asked for the back room. The table was too small to hold all of our food.  Drinks took too long to come.  We had the brussel sprouts. ...they were very interesting and tasty.  Other than that, the food was okay.  I guess I had my expectations too high. The place has an impressive menu but I was not impressed by the atmosphere. I felt like I was in a church hall at a pancake dinner. Not much ambiance. The rabbit pasta was OK. I probably just ordered the wrong thing because everyone else loved it. They have a happy hour where oysters are special price.  I went with high expectations but it was just okay.  My food wasn't seasoned enough and lot of it tasted bland.  The fish was not crispy.  Too bad because it could've been really good.  Wish they salted the water more when the potatoes were boiled because no matter how much salt I put on them, they didn't stick and it just wasn't the same.  It was super busy as usual and I waited a long time to get my water refilled.  It was my last meal in NOLA and I almost wished I had gone to Cuchon Butcher :( Luke was a good experience. I went on a weekend for brunch and really enjoyed the food. Everything was reasonably portioned but it was a little on the expensive side. I don't mind paying for food in any capacity but I spent $70 for two on brunch and that turned me off a little it. But even with the price being that high for brunch, the food was still great. Not impressed with this restaurant compared to Emeril's for the prices and John Besh was here himself, on Saturday night. But instead of walking around and making sure things were/should have been going well with his diners, he was having diner himself with three other people. Casual setting. My husband said it wasn't the best shrimp and grits as others have said. The crab appetizer was really good and my steak was great. The stuffed oysters were okay but didn't compare to Drago's. Rosemary potatoes were nice and crispy but too much Rosemary in them in my opinion. Good food but great service! Seated in the back upstairs corner table, managers checked in often. By Linh was the best server on the planet!! I tried gumbo for the first time here. It was OK, there shrimp was too squishy, something else in it tasted funny. The base of the gumbo was OK tho, maybe it was old idk but never had i had shrimp just squish in my mouth.  The service was terrible, the guy never came. I had to flag him down for a refill (which took 10 mins).  Food came out fast but i wouldn't recommend ate here for my birthday  with my family which included my 3 year old niece and 5 year old nephew. we wanted some place affordable but nice. the place was affordable yes nice not really. for a place that has an expensive frutti di mare on the menu. i would have expected it to look more upscale like his other restaurants.   i had the famous burger my sis had the shrimp and grits and my niece and nephew chicken tenders. my burger was good but not the best ive had. my sis shrimp was good but the grits were too dense for my taste.  i may be back perhaps for brunch. I just wasn't impressed. With so many wonderful places to eat in NOLA, I expected something really fantastic and just was completely under-whelmed. Happy Hour Oysters!! 75 cents!  Came for oyster happy hour with a friend while in New Orleans. Saw the great reviews figured I'd give it a shot while in the central business district.   Nice space, friendly servers and quick service.   The oysters were probably slightly above average. They seemed fresh however they were really quite sandy, which was disappointing. The sand kept us from ordering more than our original 2 dozen.   The oyster are gulf oysters which are huge compared to Washington or east coast oyster, so be prepared to order less than you expect. Since they were so large we filled up quite quickly on just 2 dozen for a happy hour snack. After I posted my review of Luke, I was contacted by their general manager who apologized profusely and let me know specifically how they were making changes to the hot room, services as well as the food.  He also invited me to come back to set things right.  Very impressive and I look forward to giving Luke another try.  Well done! Food was good.  Hostess was extremely rude though. Hostess' behavior seemed to be racially motivated as we were the only Asians in the restaurant.  I don't know if the food quality is worth the rude behavior by the staff.  I will avoid this restaurant in the future. I'm on the fence with Luke based on very poor service yet very good food.    We were greeted by a not so warm hostess and told we would be seated on time based on our reservation. Unfortunately, shortly after a group of 7 came in and were ushered ahead of us because they knew someone working at the restaurant.  Perfectly fine under most circumstances, but not when that ends up with us being seated a half hour after we were told.  Once seated, I was further disappointed that our server didn't know much about the food she was serving.   Oh well... Once the food came all was forgotten and I was a happy camper once again.   We had a lot to eat, but the roasted beets salad  and cochon de lait sandwich were standout favorites. I would have given this place a better rating but the custom service is lackluster.  The food is pretty good but the servers are rude. On the brighter side, at least the hostess was nice. Do not visit this establishment unless you are not particularly interested in good service. So they have fresh oysters, but you can get fresh oysters and a more welcoming attitude in so many other places in New Orleans. Why allow some bartender make you feel uncomfortable when you're the spending money and trying to have a good time. I stopped here and had the Southern Breakfast. It was simple, yet delicious. Eggs perfectly cooked. I had the sausage and biscuit options which were great. But the star of the dish was the jalapeño grits. Not spicy, just delicately flavored and added complexity. Service was slow and the bar smelled a bit fishy with fresh oysters being shucked. Nice and clean but oysters are ok... the fried oysters are better. Happy hour was ok... not worth for me imho I usually don't write reviews and especially negative ones FYI. That said food and drinks prices are a little but on the ridiculous side. We know chef had been on TV but that shouldn't mean you gouge your guests. Crab entrees were nothing special and shrimp and grits w poached was very good so I can recommend but still tough to justify price. Especially with all the amazing shrimp and grits choices within blocks of there.   Server was very good, hostess was wiping her runny nose on her sleeve which was not appetizing.   If have to have a meal at one of J Besh restaurants go to August for 3 course meal at lunch instead. Enjoy and happy dining in Nola! Oh also skip acme and go to Felix's right across the street. I normally love Luke's. but I came here w a group of first timers for happy hour. We ordered 100 oysters and they were dirty++, w broken shells, poorly shucked to the point where some oysters were just decimated. We had to send back 20 bc a few of us were sick of getting broken shells in our mouths. Service was good otherwise. Maybe the day we went we got the shucker on an off day. I was disappointed and my guests were too. We ordered the Sunday special Pork Grillades with gumbo and jalapeno cheese grits, and the Roast Chicken. Both were tasty, but the pork was very fatty (more than 50%) fat and the chicken was overcooked and needed to be cut off the bone and the butter knife wasn't cutting it. Maybe it was just an off night for the great reviews.   It was also a little pricey for a $$ rating on yelp. More of a 3.75. Seating is mad crowded. Happy hour prices especially for oysters and drinks are really good. It was bout $.65 per oyster. Without happy hour still not bad at $1.25ish. Definitely anything cheaper you can find in NY or Cali lol.  I didnt get to try anything else. The fried oysters were just ok.  Get there for happy hour on time. Even if ur seated, if u dont put in the order before happy hour ends you dont get the happy hour price....and im talkin even a seconds/minute off...the waitress tried to put it in and it was too late so had to pay full price. Meh. I've been to other Besh restaurants and have enjoyed the experience way way more. BOTH times that I've been to this place, I expected so much more than I got. I insisted on taking my fiance here after his NOFD Academy graduation, and to say I was embarrassed for not choosing a better spot is really an understatement. Not only was the menu minimal, it wasn't nearly what I was hoping for to celebrate such an occasion. If you're in the area and spot this place, I would honestly only go in for fries and cocktails. My experience was disappointing, but that could very well be because I ordered the wrong dish. My friend and I both ordered the Tabasco and honey fried chicken with red beans and rice, the dish was very bland. We didn't even eat half of our food. We also ordered the crab bisque and seafood gumbo, both were delicious.  The menu is pricey. My friend went here for the oysters. They used to be $0.50 during happy hour, but I guess that was awhile back. Now it's $0.75. They weren't really big either. But then again, if you're coming during happy hour, they won't serve the better choices since it would be gone fast. We were here mainly for oysters, but my friend did order a side of fries. They were pretty good. Nothing too too special. They were thin and warm when it came out to us. There was also the complimentary bread that came out. I am unsure why there was no plate provided with it as it just sat causally on the tabletop. Lol.   The service was attentive. The restaurant's atmosphere was one of a dimly lit bar scene. I guess this place is good for drinks and oysters during happy hour. Food was OK but very bad experience (the waitress dropped the source on me and my food). They did apologize but did nothing about my food. I tried to be nice though coz something like that happens. However, even I said nothing, what they responded was disappointing. Won't come back:-( 4 stars for the food:  Loved the: raw oysters and escargot,  shrimp étouffée, grits shrimp, and gumbo. 2 stars for the ambience: Felt like a meat locker in there.  Waiter tells me it's the hotel.  I literally had to get up and leave because it was so cold. I wanted to like this place more. It may have been a problem of my expectations. I thought that Luke was Cajun but a lot of the dishes were French.  I enjoyed the beet salad a lot more than my shrimp and grits. They were ok. The shrimp and grits at Dante's Kitchen are way better. My friend did not like her fish dish. After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed.  The service was a little off. It seemed like our waiter was trying to upsell us and the prices were steep for what you actually got. Brunch was very nice. Our server was attentive. But the meal started off rocky when we waited forever for our soup & and it ended up coming out with the meal. The portion size of my shrimp and grits was a bit smaller than I expected for the price, but it did not lack in taste. I was very excited to try the bread pudding because of yelp reviews & pictures, but it was a tad underwhelming. It was very dense. The crawfish bisque was yummy and mimosas were on the house! It was an experience I can check off my list, but I can't say I would return. Not my best New Orleans dinner experience.  Service was slow on a Tuesday night when they were no where near full.  The bread they bring to each table is meh.  Opening corn and crab chowder was very good.  I ordered the Tuesday special, a trio of pork.  I expected the pork belly to be fatty, it always is, but the slices of pork were mostly fat, and the fried pork neck was bland.  Overall, the dish had about 7-8 bites of pork meat. I was still hungry.  The fries were good.  PS. I forgot when I first wrote this. My dinner came with bread pudding for desert. Best. Ever.  Crusty on top with lots pecans, soft and delicious in the center.  i won't be beating down the door to go back. Luke was overall pretty good. I would say 3.5 stars. The crawfish bisque was good, it had a good flavor, lots of crawfish, and smooth consistency, but I've had better. The blue crab and shrimp étouffée was very good, but very small, like really small, portion for an entree. The shrimp and grits was also very good, but small. There could have been more grits and it would have been more satisfying. The bread pudding was the best I've had at a restaurant. The sauce was great and it came with vanilla bean ice cream on top! Best part of the meal! If the portions were bigger, I would def give Luke 4-4.5 stars! The service was excellent but the food so-so. My mussels were big, juicy, fresh. But the sauce was bland, a sort of creamy thing with no real notes of garlic, butter, pepper or wine. Bleh. But I ate because I like mussels. The pork shank was huge and filling but not terribly smokey. The crème brûlée was awful. The sugar was fired well ahead of time and the crème itself was very blah--a tasteless custard that was not set correctly. The place is loud on weekends so not for a cozy dinner. On the up side, the service was great and the oysters superb. I'd give it another go just to see. Attempted to go here for dinner - checked open table to make sure there were open reservations. There were plenty (we weren't sure how many would be in our party so I was reluctant to make a reservation before I had confirmed everyone). When we got there I was told a table for two was 2 hours. I checked open table again when we exited - I still could have made a reservation for virtually any time in the evening, there were plenty of empty tables as well. Not sure what the thought was here... Ended up choosing Luke after a few trips to New Orleans.  Nice space with nice decor.    Ordered: Crawfish beignets Raw Oysters  Shrimp and grits  Burgers    The oysters were huge!!!!!     Crawfish beignets were average at best.   The sauce was delicious.  Friends enjoyed the burgers and the presentation was nice.  The shrimp and grits were tasty but could have had some more heat.  All in all not a bad choice. Poor. Breakfast was terrible. Staff was not helpful and seemed inconvenienced by the business. I heard good things about this place but I was verry disappointed.  Yogurt and granola had an odor to it. Toast was burnt. Eggs were cold. Poor poor poor. I'm not sure if we went on an off night but our experience was memorable in a bad way.   The waitstaff wasn't coordinated, drinks took forever, and our food was LÜKEwarm.   Out of the four of us, only one enjoyed the meal -- the ribeye. The other dishes were either bland or overflavored.   Additionally, we witnessed one of the waitstaff eating fries off one of our entrees, which left a horrible impression.   We walked out of the restaurant irritated because Lüke was the first restaurant we chose to try as soon as we got to NOLA. Not too good, not too bad. Service was slow but food was okay. Probably not worth the money though Was there for breakfast.  I had the healthy breakfast- yogurt with granola and berries.  It was ok.  Service was decent.  Not a place I'd go back, but I am glad I tried it once. Was here on New Years Day in the afternoon and swear I spotted a couple of actresses, though I am hard pressed to find their names. The coffee was delicious, good Bloody Mary's and the service was on point. Get the P&J oysters, you won't be disappointed. I followed it up with the burger. It was good, not outstanding. I could not finish it. My date got the Eggs in Purgatory and those were rich and decadent. She had the jalapeño grits and they were absolutely amazing. We couldn't stop eating them. Forgo the French fries for the grits, you can thank me later. I was very excited when I found a John mesh restaurant in my hotel. Than extremely disappointed with breakfast. The meal started with a miscommunication with our server and continued downhill from there. I ordered the egg white frittata which came out over cooked and tasting like it was fried in bacon grease. The side of potatoes were fried in bacon grease and contained bacon. As a vegetarian I was pretty dismayed the menu failed to mention this.   My husbands plate was lackng the accompania to advertised. The grits were dry and the requested butter to put on them took 15 minutes to arrive.   I would try this restaurant again but would choose lunch or dinner. Good food. Lovely staff. I had the crab omelet which was good but slightly over cooked egg. The accompanying waffle fries were delicious. This restaurant just wasn't as fabulous as Restaurant August and Domenica, so perhaps my expectations were too high. Worst service of my life. Sat down at the bar and the bartender didn't even wipe down the bar! We each had a drink and changed our dinner plans because we decided we didn't want to sit with our elbows in crushed saltines and old basil. Wish I could comment  on the food, but like I said the bad service made us change out dinner plans. We got there barely in time for the happy hour oysters. $.75. Quite a deal. They were huge! Also got the happy hour drinks good deal. Had the crawfish etoufoille. It tasted a little squid like for me. But that is probably how the dish was supposed to be. My wife got The softshell crab BLT. It was the biggest softshell crab I had ever seen. She ate it all even thiugh she had a huge lunch. It was great. We love Lüke, but shocked they took the veal Jäger schnitzel, spaetzle and other items off their menu, so they are not really considered \"German\" anymore.  It's a real shame too, since Lüke was the last restaurant in New Orleans that served it now that \"Jäger Haus\" (only other German Restaurant in the city) has closed. Had dinner here on my trip to NOLA. Food was tasty just a tad on the salty side for my taste. Fine dining prices with terrible service does not make a great meal. Our waiter took forever to greet us and seemed completely disinterested once he finally did. He got both of my parent's orders wrong and they had thoroughly discussed their food allergies and sensitivities with him while ordering. The pacing of the meal was totally off; entrees were brought as appetizers and appetizers as entrees. Once it was set right, the food was all very good but the service left us all with a bad taste. I don't think I'll be returning. The interior is crowded and dim, but not in a cozy way.  We were seated at a table so close to the next patrons that we heard their entire conversation as if they were sitting with us.   The menu is limited and the service was so so (with the exception of the greeter who was genuinely friendly and attentive).   Regarding the food, the biscuits were bland; the fries were cold and the corn bisque was watery.  I ordered a Bloody Mary - although it was tasty, it was almost non-alcoholic.  For those it matters to, I think we were the only locals in the place. This place is coasting on a name. Our first impression was that the service was terrible. Food was mediocre and service continued to be terrible. Actually writing this review while waiting ten minutes with dirty plates in front of us, waiting to be cleared. Asked for the check as soon as we finally found someone to clear the table. Can't wait to get out of here. So many better places to eat in NOLA! Thanks to the large, bald-headed man that looked like the manager... Lüke, you make me want to PUKE!! Service was so horrible, it left a bad taste in my mouth from our trip to New Orleans. They did not make any effort to accommodate our bachelorette party group without a reservation! This is an overpriced bistro with decent food. The restaurant lacks the kind of ambiance to justify their prices for food that is just OK. After reading rave reviews of Luke in our guide book and double checking on Yelp! we were excited to try it. Luke probably serves the most inspired German food in New Orleans, but it is still German food. We were excited for dinner on my wife's first trip to NOLA and decided to try this place based on reviews and the menu we saw online. We ordered the pate \"scented with truffles\" there was certainly no truffle flavor but the pate was very good. I had the Etouffee which was good and she had the entrecote with fries which was perfectly cooked but served with a massive portion of butter. Overall the food was good but the service was slow and almost uninterested even though they were two waiters assigned to our table. Two stars seems generous. First, they don't have control over their A/C and heat because they're connected to a hotel, and it was FREEZING. Literally everyone in the place had their jackets on, and the food became lukewarm almost instantly. Second, the service was poor and uninformed--everyone there seemed peeved, and clueless about wine. Third, I had the bizarre mozzarella-topped ham and cheese sandwich, and my homegirl had jãgerschnitzel, both of which are kind of hard to mess up--we both could only bring ourselves to eat half of our portions with great willfulness. The ambiance is nice, but kind of chain-y, which could also be said of the food. It was a huge bummer to spend so much money on such sub-par food. A bit disappointing for brunch. They were understaffed and service was slow. Brunch menu is a bit limited. Had the fried chicken and biscuit which was solid. The egg on top was superfluous and forgettable. Shrimp and grits were just ok for the high price point.   Update: went back again for oysters at happy hour. Service was still pretty bad. The quality of the shucking was awful. There were gooey globs of dirt on the shells and on the oysters and most of the brine was gone. The food is great but the service is terrible.   Wife had shrimp grits (awesome but a little salty)  I had the rib eye and it was cooked to perfection. But I am still waiting for the dessert menu an I think I will be here until infinity. Jumbo shrimp does not have any flavor but being salty. Happy hour has cheap and good oysters. Should be able to use real butter instead of hydrogenated oil in their dishes boo !!!!! This is not a 2 $ place. Portion size was small and prices were large. Liked the food but would have liked more of it. Service was a little forgetful but friendly. Would not go back. This restaurant is the lobby of the Hilton where we were staying.  We tried three times to get in for a before dinner snack and twice for dessert each time the hostesses were less than friendly and told us that the wait would be over 30 minutes as we were staring at multiple empty tables.  The hotel staff advised us to order room service and that we wouldn't be refused. So we decided to do that while we sat in the lobby and people watched.  The hotel staff had been wonderful the hostesses at Luke not so much. They are so rude. The service was kind of lack luster and the food was pretty good.  I would definitely recommend the baked PJ/ herbsaint oysters, they were delicious, they had a light breeding on then which consisted of herbs, bread and cheese. They were then lightly baked but not too long... They were still slightly raw. I thought it was delicious, and so didn't the other 3 that were with me.  We also had the hot boudin Louisiana 2which was actually really good too.  The étouffée was good, not amazing.  We also had raw oysters which were very good and lastly, the shrimp and grits... Which was probably the best entree. Service was good. But the food was incredibly salty. Beyond anything I've ever eaten. We ate at quite a few other Cajun/Creole places during our time in New Orleans. This was by far the worst due to the amount of salt used. Went there for a late desert. Cheese cake ... did not care for the after taste. Crumble... it was ok. Felt like my homemade was better. Seemed like a cool vibe great service just fell short on flavor Only 2 stars because everyone was nice other than that food was too salty and uncooked. I'm the type to not bother so I did not say anything, but, never again. Food very good  - waitress had a bit of an attitude and rather spoiled the experience - Shawn just acted like she wasn't trying. Poor breakfast spot. We asked for an americano and latte and they brought drip coffee and drip coffee with milk. I'd prefer some honesty that they don't have an espresso machine. Also no fresh orange juice. This place is more casual than I initially expected, but it still has a nice ambience. My friend had the shrimp and grits (which was everyone's favorite) because it was packed with flavor. I had the chicken and it was a little dry for me. We also shared a bottle of wine. The prices were reasonable. I basically have a crush on all John Besh restaurants and I LOVE that this place is open later than most!!  The beet salad is great!  I love the mix of blue cheese and pistachios.  It's a perfect appetizer to go with the bread they bring out.  I went for the bacon cheeseburger, fancy I know.  This thing was huge and so good.  The fries that come with it are small and thin so if you're into that you'll be all over it.    I've been for brunch before a Saints game but since it was so crazy busy that day I can't judge the service too bad.  Everyone is distracted on football Sunday!  The waffle was delicious no matter how long it look. Restaurant week menu had smaller portions, but overall very good. Wow, spent 200 bucks on food that had  NO FLAVOR. From crab legs to soup, boring and tasteless.  Hostess totally forgot about us. Not worth the $$$ or time A concierge highly recommended this restaurant.  It was solid-good.  I would not say out-of-this world great. I found the gumbo to be fair at best. My shrimp and grits entree was very good. The wine list was good with nice selections by he glass. Service was very good.  No reason not to eat here, but frankly nothing that would make me want to go back either. Nice atmosphere, pleasant people, excellent friendly service and great cocktails at reasonable prices. BUT... be warned, the food here is mediocre at best This place was awful. Freezing cold, almost idiotic staff and really bad food. I mean BAD. My meat was tough, the spaetzle was dry and flavorless, the wine was no good, and my dining partners sandwich seemed as if it was a joke. It was huge, covered in cheese and almost inedible in size and flavor. I cannot begin to even fathom where these good reviews are coming from, or how they can justify these prices. I really would have rather eaten fast food than this crap. Decided to try out Lüke's since it was next door to the hotel I was staying at. The hostess seemed surprised that I didn't want to sit at the bar because I was alone. Three parties were seated before me, but I was finally seated after waiting 10-minutes. The server took a while to get to me and only showed up sporadically to check on me, but was very friendly when he did show up. Started off with the Blue Crab Bisque - nice flavor and nice helping of crab. For an entrée I had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\". Wow!!! The shrimp was very flavorful... The grits were absolutely wonderful!!! My boyfriend and I went here last week just to try out for dinner. I don't know because we came in a little late but the servers didnt give us the service like an upscale restaurant suppose to be. They put us in a corner all the way at the end where it was so dark that we had to ask for better seats, and they wasn't busy at all. Then we had to ask for our plates because the guy forgot to give us when they served the bread and butter. On top of that, all the servers was messing around, talking, laughing really loud to each others. They even started to punch each others, chasing around right infront of our table. The food was ok that why I have two stars. Don't know if we should come back Service is always great. Which is why it gets three stars.   The food and menu have taken a dive though.  I've eaten here at least 6-8 times over the years   It used to be really great.  The steak was Just salty, Pork Schnitzel had no flavor, gumbo also just eh.... Not worthy.  The menu has been chopped down to what seems like bar food.  Not sure what happened here!?  Everything used to be excellent.  You can do a lot better for your money in this town Came here for happy hour after the game. The person seating the customers looked completely overwhelmed. She sat people who were behind us first. Then lied to make excuses for not being able to keep track of everyone.  Would've like to try this place out, but the management has no idea how to seat customers :o I feel like I should have come here for dinner! We stopped by for breakfast. The shrimp and grits were amazing (high calorie).  According to the waiter it's also his favorite dish and that it's even better with crawfish during the season for it! I like dark roast coffee. I think the roast used in their press is lighter. My husband had the Southern breakfast and the biscuit was too mushy. I would replace it with toast. Hope this helps breakfast hunting! In terms of the experience-to-price ratio, Luke's breakfast asymptotically approached zero.  Our initial cup of coffee was, not ironically, lukewarm. It was eventually replaced, but only sporadically filled. (It bears mentioning that our server was managing exactly two tables.) The toast also was no better than room temperature - incidentally about 65 degrees - and it was replaced as well. The yogurt and granola featured no more than three tablespoons of insubstantial, powdery granola and perhaps half a cup of berries for $12. This stood in stark contrast to the previous evening's uniformly outstanding experience at Emeril's, at which no detail was overlooked.  The server predictably made no accommodation on our bill for either transgression, and so it was that we left $34 poorer, literally and metaphorically. Easy pick--shrimp and grits. It's a southern staple and it is done really well here. You won't hear this often...the butter is outrageously good. That's right, the butter that comes with the mini baguette is actually memorable.   One knock...the gumbo. Specifically, the shrimp IN the gumbo. I suppose since it is made in huge vats and sits, the shrimp gets mealy, otherwise I would actually suspect that it's *gasp* frozen. Great flavor, but the texture of the shrimp is a big turn off. Went in for dinner on Sunday night.  Fries were as good as everyone says they are.  My \"chocroute?\" skillet of sausages and pork pieces had a quarter inch of liquid fat in it, which was a little much for me and my wife, and I'll try almost anything.  There are definitely better things on the menu.  Waiter was terrible, but the observant hostess was on her game, jumped in and saved the day.  Fortunately, they also sport a fantastic dessert menu - espresso profiterols & more, all excellent.  That pastry chef has got skills. The food was excellent but unfortunately the service made the night less than memorable. We ordered an appetizer plus a seafood platter with crab legs and a bottle of wine. We had to refill our wine twice (which isn't easy while cracking claws) and my utensils (claw cracker, little fork, shell plate) were taken before I was finished. The service was overall aloof and rushed. Had it not been for the unwelcoming service we would have stayed for dessert and cocktails (i.e. more business for the restaurant). There were only a few tables that night. It is unfortunate that we will not recommend this restaurant to friends, despite the quality of the food. Super let down. So to be fair nothing was horrible or anything like that but at this price point I think it's ok to expect a little more. 5 minutes after we got our appetizers were delivered they showed up with the entrées and you either have to send your food back to sit under heat lamps or inhale your apps- they whole experience was like that - extremely rushed and not really what one would expect. Pâté was probably the only real standout - all the other items you've had before and likely better and with better service. I joined YELP so I could write a review of this restaurant.  On day 3 of our trip June 15, I convinced my fiancé to go here because it's a John Besh restaurant, and it was terrible.  We left feeling like we were just robbed.  Not one of the three hostesses greeted us.  The service was slow, took fifteen minutes for our wine decanter to arrive, although our waitress was something close to nice.  The food arrived fast, but it was AWFUL.  I almost cried.  The Friday special, the court bouillon, had a synthetic taste to it.  My fiancé's roasted chicken was bland, but the mashed potatoes and crawfish bisque stood out in a sea of terrible.  The atmosphere is so lackluster - and on a FRIDAY NIGHT.  Never again. This place was a good happy hour experience because the cocktails were half off and the oysters were discounted. I had the French 75, which they make with cognac instead of gin; vastly preferable. I'm not sure I would eat here without the discount. Still, good place. Mint julep- Very very very strong. I guess they give you your moneys worth but I felt like I was just drinking a big cup of bourbon. I did not taste much else besides that  Gumbo- Flavorful and chunky goodness. Prob the best gumbo I had in New Orleans.  Jumbo Lousiana Shrimp En Cocotte- Loved every bite of this. Shrimp was fresh and cooked just right. Grits was creamy and perfect. This was my first time having grits and I was impressed.  Brendan's Bread Pudding was ok but the Gateau  Basque Vanilla cake was gross. It was excessively sweet also very dry. Disappointing. Food was top notch - we had crab legs, beet salad and crespelle - all were spectacular. Unfortunately, the service was sub par. The courses were served on top of one another (half way into the salad, they delivered the main course) and shortly after, they were asking about dessert. We were clearly being rushed out. Expected much better from this type of establishment. Borderline offensive. Went w friends for dinner.   Food: It was just okay. Swordfish dish was a no. Flavorless and dry. Ribeye steak...average. Lack flavor and nice char. Some got the butter on top and some didn't.  Limited menu.  Place across the street was awesome and meat seemed like a better grade.   Location/site: Clean and cute. Smaller place. Making a reservation would be a good idea.  Service: good dinner service. Just so so, only is that location good, near to conference center and CBD, the food is definitely not $$, very little food for each entree, taste ok. Service, as we experienced today is not that good, wait a really long time for dishes. And no waitor add water. I came here with a few girlfriends for dinner and the service was a joke. Our server was rude for no reason... I mean, he set our water carafe on my breadplate. Wtf!? Weird. The only bad service we've experienced in New Orleans. This city is awesome. More of 3.5, and I'm rounding down. This was our big splurge meal of the weekend.  Another group of 7 ppl, and the food was only ok.  I split the seafood tower without the  lobster ($65) with a bunch of people, and everything was fresh, but I feel like there should have been more seafood for the price.  Ambience was good, up-scale without being stuffy.  I split the smoked pork shank with my girlfriend who's on the Paleo diet (urgh, don't ask), and it was a bit dry, in my opinion.  The sauerkraut underneath was delish though.  The bread pudding dessert was rich and satisfying.  Coffee: sooo good.  I only got decaf and it was full-bodied, and had no burnt, acidic aftertaste that is so signature of that place called Starbucks.  Everyone else seemed to be enjoying the food, and the service was quite friendly and attentive. Service was disinterested, but the food was good:  - Oysters were delicious - Gumbo was only OK. Disappointed given the raves - Shrimp and grits were really good. Really liked the touch of jalapeno.  We saw a bunch of people order the burger which looked really tasty. If I'm ever back in town, will try that! Excellent service, but the food was really really overrated. Was expecting much more. Everything was really fried and not overly refined. Service was very good though! Came here specifically for the Oysters during happy-hour and thought they were \"okay.\"  My group of girlfriends were so excited, we ended up ordering 2-dozen Oysters along with appetizers such as: crispy brussels sprouts, shrimp & grits, and house-made fries. The oysters weren't shucked correctly and we had a few unfortunate surprises during our meal =(   Overall, it's a good place to get your oyster fix while in NoLa but it definitely is not the best. Despite perfectly good food, the surly demeanor of the help from front to back can't overcome the bad taste left in my mouth after eating at Luke. I took my son and his lady for Brunch recently and was thoroughly disappointed, especially after the stellar food, service and atmosphere at Borgne - where everyone seems genuinely happy to see you! Not sure why two places owned by the same group offer such wildly divergent experiences, but Luke is off my list for dining in the Big Easy. I wanted to like Luke more, but my two visits here have led me to only 3 very generous stars.   First visit here a year or so ago we were seated towards the back by a bust stand and stared at dirty dishes all night long.  This was so distracting I can't even remember if what I ate tasted any good.  It must have been decent since I didn't just leave mid meal.  I complained to the manager who had the dishes removed but within a minute there were dishes piled up on the stand again.   Second visit we had the seafood tower for two and it was a huge disappointment.  I'm tempted to try Luke again because of all the great reviews but not sure if I will. Ate at Lukes 4 times.  The first time it was great...the next three times it was barely edible.  Twice got one of the specials and was sadly disappointed.  The last time, I opted for the same dish I first enjoyed and it was not at all the same.  Hope his other restaurants are better. I love John Besh's show. I was underwhelmed. After coming off of a cold watching the bartender slam paperless straws with her bare hands wasn't fun. She also wiped at her nose a few times which made me no longer want to drink. The food was ok. Lauren, the other bartender was very professional and the cleanest looking employee there. I did buy one of the cookbooks Boyfriend and I took a mini vacation to New Orleans and wanted to try a local restaurant near our hotel. Based on reviews, we went to Luke to try it out.  ***Experience. It was A-OK.  We made a reservation and when we arrived, they said we can sit in the bar... Normally when I make a reservation, I expect at least a formal seating arrangement to have been ready or at least close to being ready. The service was decent. Nothing amazing but people just doing their jobs and serving you normally.  ***Ambiance: I expected it to be a little bit more on the fancy/intimate side but it's not. The lighting didn't make any romantic vibe but that's okay.  *** Food: I ordered the steak/fries and my bf ordered a seafood pasta or something. They were both good savory meals. I found weeks Luke's by checking out a gluten free restaurant option google search for New Orleans.  I'm so happy I decided to make reservations!  The food was incredible! The staff listened to my food restriction requests and delivered with tasty food.  Not just leaving off ingredients but making adjustments to the dish which enhances the flavors.  It was our favorite meal of the trip *(0 stars for the hostesses at the front, as I was met with rude stares and unfriendly demeanor upon looking for my party)  Group of about 12 of us, we came for some bites and HH oysters. We ordered a few dozen of these, some crab and corn chowder, and shrimp and grits. Everything was exquisite.... The oysters were FAT and the chowder was thick, the shrimp and grits were also to die for........ The food was nothing short of food-coma inducing.   The service, however, was super...... s l o w. Some orders came out late or perhaps even forgotten altogether. This combined with the surly hostesses at the front made the experience kind of meh. Food = 5/5 though. overpriced.  Had the swordfish and it was dry, possibly over cooked.  It was also about 6 ounces.  $28 for a 6 oz swordfish that wasn't very good.  Disappointing.  Overall it's a nice restaurant but it is overrated. I wish Yelp had half a star, because this should be 3.5 stars. I might be punishing this place just for not living up to my expectations, but I was underwhelmed. The brussel sprouts were the stand-out (so much so that we requested the recipe). But an appetizer should never be the most memorable part of a meal in my opinion. Honestly the brussel sprouts almost earned that 4th star from me, but I just can't seem to make myself do it. Why not? Well, we had a seafood tower (the medium sized) and the crab was over cooked (really???). A few of the mussels seemed over cooked to me as well but I might be nit-picking. They should get those things right every time. In any event, maybe try the brussel sprouts and a salad. I've come here for lunch once but dinner was just terrible. We ended up ordering the steak and the shrimp and grits. Also ordered a few drinks which were actually delightful, so that's the saving grace for the 2 stars.  Steak was well over cooked and ended up being way too SALTY, and so were the grits. Our food was barley touched and ended up being a total let down. It was surprising to see a restaurant of that caliber have issues with seasoning.  We were extremely disappointed but you win some you lose some, they did end up giving us a free dessert which was the \"Salted Caramel\". Not sure if that was unintended or clever joke. But needless to say we won't be going back here again. Plenty of other places to try, so it's hard to give a place a second chance. The waitstaff was overly attendant but very slow moving.  I thought it was just a southern quality but it was a bit over the top.  We were there for over 2 hours with a large group and a pretty empty restaurant.  If you want to take a slow leisurely brunch, then this is your spot!  But if not, I'd skip it because the food wasn't extraordinary either.  Their jalapeno grits are enjoyable. Having read the rave reviews for Luke, we couldn't NOT try it out for ourselves. The food and service were good but we were disappointed that they were out of all draft beers and, a bigger sin, out of foie gras. The dish that was recommended instead (rabbit liver pate) was okay but much too rich to finish even half of it. The moules frites were excellent and the portion generous. Front of house was a touch indifferent and lacking in Southern hospitality. All in all, would still strongly recommend but perhaps check ahead of time for availability of dishes you absolutely want to enjoy. I bookmarked this place from my last visit to Nola. I was super excited to try this place! Upon arriving  the atmosphere was better than I expected (upscale).  Me and my husband ordered the chicken biscuit which is a larger plate so we decided to share. The presentation was excellent the chicken was tender, juicy, & flavorful. I also order a mimosa it wasn't the best I've had I asked to have it returned and order another drink.  Upon eating half way through my meal my chicken wasn't done all the way. Instead of sending it back and getting my ordered comped I paid for everything.   Honestly I don't know if I'll try them again I attended last night's Sunday Supper at Luke's.  It was really rather fun sitting with a bunch of strangers and sharing food and conversation.  I enjoyed the overall experience.  Three of the four courses were great but the coq au vin was one tough, dry bird-even with the yummy sauce.  It was authentically made with rooster, but I thought if you slow cook something long enough it would eventually become tender.  That didin't happen.  On the other hand, the oysters, baked and raw, the king crab legs thermador, the butternut squash with shrimp bisque, and the baba au rhum were all great, even if the shrimp in the bisque were a bit salty.  If only they'd been able to pull off the main course, this would have been a five star review. All the food was excellent and prepared well.  Pricey to be sure (5 crawfish beignets with 1 tiny crawfish each for $15?), but very tasty.  The service was lousy with our disinterested waiter really putting a damper on the meal. The meal was saved when another waiter noticed, swooped in, and started taking care of us.  His name was Steve or Rich... great guy from Chicago.  At any easy $100 before tip for 2 people with 2 drinks, appetizers and entrees, I am not sure I can give a glowing recommendation.   It feels a little greedy for a small bistro with a very limited menu, but it was a very tasty meal. Ate Xmas Lunch here. Downside: they ran out of shrimp. Upside: great crab omelette. Reasonably priced and lots of locals. Saw chef John Besh being interviewed on network TV, so I decided to come to Luke to find out what the hype was.    Beautiful restaurant in an old school look.  Excellent service.  I had the shrimp cavatelli etouffee with extra fried shrimp on top.  The cavatelli with cheese was ok, didn't need the extra shrimp which didn't add anything to the dish.  The bread pudding was excellent.    Should have ordered the gumbo. this review is only for happy hour drinks and oysters: the oysters weren't as clean,fresh and big as the oysters across the street (Trenasse) and there was very limited drinks on the happy hour menu. There were still pieces of shell on the oysters and they smelled very fishy. The fried oysters were even worse; they were very hard to chew. if you're looking for a good happy hour joint, save yourself a hassle and go across the street to Trenasse (they have much bigger, fresher, cleaner, variety of oysters).  This place is overrated! My girlfriend and I came here for lunch one Saturday afternoon and we split a dozen raw oysters and the Cochon de Lait sandwich, washed down with peach mimosas. It was all very good, but it wasn't happy hour!   Unfortunately, we only learned about the happy hour after our meal and since we were only visiting New Orleans for a few days, its we couldn't just give another go at it. As much as we enjoyed our food, we couldn't help but feel like we could have enjoyed it a lot more during happy hour. Whenever I mention to anybody that we went to Luke in New Orleans, people ask, \"Did you get the happy hour?\" and I can only sullenly lower my head and utter, \"no...\".  Without the happy hour, it just feels utterly ordinary. To be fair: I didn't actually get to dine here. But I still got low-rent service from a high-rent joint. And I wound up *way* happier down the street (see my review for Gallier).  Upon inquiring about a seat at the bar, the hostess said it was \"first come, first served,\" and that it's usually a quick 15-30 min wait. After confirming it was okay to wait at the door, others trickled in 10-15 mins later also asking about the bar, and the hostess repeated the \"first come\" line. But she neglected to tell them I was the 1st person waiting for the bar--and didn't seem to mind when the follow-up folks waiting stood over the shoulders of dining bar patrons, waiting to poach their seats.  After waiting a few more minutes to see how it'd play out (nothing changed), I left. And I don't plan on coming back. The service was pretty bad. The food was ok but not exceptional. This place used to be very very good. I won't be coming back with my friends when it's time to pick a restaurant. The food is all right, nothing special.  The service is horrendous.  They treat you like your presence is a total inconvenience to them.  We even saw the bartender roll his eyes at us.  Sorry I bothered you Mr. Fantastic, but I'm a paying customer and my money is as good as the lady in the Prada shoes, so treat me with a little respect.  Anyway, that's all I have to say about this place. 1. Surprised this is attached to a Hilton 2. Space is small 3. Food seemed salty 4. Wine list all Euro  Started w/ French 75 Cocktail. No mention of sugar on menu (cognac, lemon juice, champagne) but sweet.   Had the Salad with Oyster, split for two. Lots of Oysters for a split.   Shared Burger and Cassoulet. Burger was ok, did not like the small wooded cutting board as a serving plate. Awkward. Fries in Mint Julip cup were fine but salty.  Speaking of salt, Cassoulet was very, did not like the Garlic Sausage or the beans with Panko on top.   Server was nice. Prices decent. I'll make it real simple, no fancy words or beautiful descriptions.  Basically if you want a good meal at a good price with good service this is NOT the place to go.  I repeat it is NOT the place to go.  Service was slow, in fact we almost got up and left until they finally sent the bartender over to take our order.  The food is overpriced.  I had the crab salad and it didn't come with any salad.  Just a heap of crab meat, no flavor, and the bread that came with it was burned.  When I told the hostess, the bartender was standing next to her, and described how they put that particular bread on the grill and sometimes it comes out burned.  I couldn't eat it.  It was black through and through.  nuf said. Unless I'm here for happy hour oysters (everyday between 3-6) the price doesn't match what I'm eating. The happy hour oysters price went up recently from 50 cents each to 75 cents each. Maybe that's to get rid of people who aren't as fancy as the building suggests should be like me. Blind Pelican down the street offers much cheaper happy hour oysters now. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things but this place was not good at all.  We went here for dinner and I ordered the express menu which included soup, redfish court-bouillon and bread pudding.  For the soup, I ordered the gumbo but had to send it back because it was painfully salty.  Not just a little bit salty but it tasted like someone dumped in the whole shaker.  I sent that back and got the crawfish bisque which was not inedible.  The redfish court-bouillon was decent, nothing special and again seemed to be oversalted.  The bread pudding looked great but was just ok - probably the best part of a subpar meal.  Overall, very disappointing.  This place may be a great place to go for happy hour but for dinner it was not very good. You ruined my late valentines dinner with my wife. Not only was the service staff as unprofessional as could be, the kitchen staff completely dropped the ball. They could not cook a medium rare steak on the first or second attempt, then to have the balls to try and send me a free dessert to make up for the shortcoming was ridiculous. How about you just cook the steak right? Our server talking to us as if we were his friends and showing zero professionalism was another glaring issue, our table had a view into the kitchen and never once did I see the so called chef or any member of the kitchen taste anything they sent out. If this place is supposed to be a better option then the joints on Bourbon street, well the New Orleans you guys are fucked. I work nearby and got takeout breakfast here one morning. The food was out quick and very nicely packaged w a separate closed container for my grits. The grits themselves were creamy but the flavor was not for me. The chicken biscuit would have been absolutely delicious, had the actual biscuit not been hard as a rock. The people that work there are nice. I will give this place another try when I can dine in. Went there for Sunday brunch and was disappointed with food, menu and ambience. Oysters were good though. Will not return My husband and I had a 1pm lunch reservation. We were seated promptly. The server came over, after a short while, and asked about drinks. After a long while, he came and took our order. My husband had the Monday Expess...soup & fried chicken. He chose the crawfish bisque. ..it was outstanding. The chicken was served with red beans & rice. The red beans & rice, took the crispiness away from the chicken. I had the shrimp & grits. The shrimp were nicely cooked, but I expected more spiciness from the dish. Our main complaint,  was the lack of service. The server was not attentive, we had to ask for bread. He was nice enough,  he seemed a little lost. I don't mind paying for good food, but I hate places where you feel taken advantage of. Lüke was one of those places. A chef-owned restaurant that thinks charging $27 for a BLT is justifiable, and charging full price for 11oz beers is OK. In the middle of New Orleans, where good food is everywhere, you find yourself wondering why you're eating here. To add, in the middle of all this pretentiousness, the silverware was filthy and the service was awful. We were ignored for a good 15 minutes while the table next to ours was being doted on...I'd say save your money and go eat somewhere else in the French Quarter. The shrimp and grits were the best I had ever had. The beneits were a bit sour tasting, not to our liking. The basic egg / bacon and biscuit plate was so so. Came in for lunch during the week and went with the daily special. Service is slow but staff is friendly enough. The high ceilings make it a loud place. They can accommodate larger groups. Crab bisque is a little too heavy on the corn and almost no crab, the base is creamy and just a tad spicy which made it quite savoury. Shrimp with ham, vegetables and jasmine rice are only bearable because they come with an ok sauce, but the items separately (except the very fatty ham) are bland, really tasteless. Portions are small even for lunch, specially because there's no complimentary bread or anything but given the price I guess it's ok ($17). Food is OK although feel a little over-priced.  The Etoufee and smoked pork shank are good, although nothing really super to justify the price.  The desserts are good although nothing really strikes me.  I like the restaurant but at similar price I can get MUCH better food in my home town (SF Bay Area). Maybe I am just spoiled... We had a reservation for three at 730 and arrived around 715.  We were seated at 725 and greater promptly by our server.  We received our drinks and the server answered all of our questions.  The gumbo was full of shrimp oysters and okra, very tasty with great consistency. The baked oysters were just \"fair\", cooked only half through.    Two of us ordered the Luke burger and one had the crab legs.  The burger was huge and has a great flavor brought out by the caramelized onions and bacon.  The fries were decent but a bit over cooked.  The crab legs presented nicely and were full and delicious.  All in all a great experience and would go back again when in NOLA! This place is insanely overrated.  I guess it's good if you're staying at the hotel and it has a super convenient location but otherwise I would avoid it.  The food isn't bad but one of its best qualities is that it won't make you sick.  I'll pass next time I'm in New Orleans and recommend you do the same. Dining here would be cool maybe if it didn't come with a side of waiters talking about how they would fuck me. Y'all are around a corner, my boyfriend and  I can still hear you assholes. Had breakfast there a while back, and although the scrambled eggs, biscuits were ok, the sausage and bacon was highly salted and smoked.  An acquired taste not easy to get used to, being from California.  So would not order those items again.  However, the gumbo was excellent. Happy hour is cool service is great...I feel the food is over priced... Your never sure if you never know if its worth it. Went once and I won't miss not going again. Its price point makes it not worth it...over rated and over priced. Its a poor east of my per diem... Never again The happy hour oysters are reaaaaally cheap! 75cents per oyster! We had a dozen--the oysters are quite fresh and big. The shrimp and grits are average though. Got the shrimp + grits topped with crabmeat, but for a ~$40 dish... I thought it would be better? Definitely nothing special, didn't even finish it.   The cocktail (champagne au poire) was also so-so, tasted rather pulpy and heavy on the sugar content.   Ambience was terrible. Usually that's not a big deal if the quality of the food can redeem the place, but they seriously need to up their game in the interiors. For example, this was brunch and the whole place was super dark because they didn't open any of the shutters... really?? You'd think that at this price point they would know better.   Acoustics were also terrible. Super loud and the screaming baby next to me didn't help.   Will not be back. Very disappointed with the food and service.  When I walked in, the host stood there on the phone, ignored me.  So I stood there staring at him for nearly 3 min.  Unfriendly host put us all the way in the back room. Our server never smiled.  Maybe it's New Orleans thing.  People are not friendly here overall. Popular downtown spot with good food and service. I wouldn't call it special, but it was a convenient place to eat before an NBA game. We had breakfast at this restaurant today. I have to say that I found it to be a pretentious and unwelcoming. I got the southern breakfast. This included two eggs, three sausage links, biscuit, and grits for $15. The grits had a firm, congealed consistency. The links were good. The eggs were forgettable. The biscuit was cool and hard around the edges. My wife had the spicy frittata. This was pretty spicy but it was tasty. Overall, I found this place expensive and forgettable. The server, refilled our coffee once and never refilled our glasses of water. Once the food came out, she lost interest in our table. I doubt that we will return. How does a chef ruin chicken and waffles? I went for sunday brunch and the food was horrible...soggy waffles and greasy chicken. The waiter was nice and offered me another entree but I had already lost confidence.  I would not recommend it! I work in the medical field and the white lab/doctor coats the waitstaff wears, just throws me off. Also the kitchen rags they use as dinner napkins. I get it, they trying to pull something different off, right? The food was okay, not great as I heard it would be. Worth skipping and eating some place else. This place was huge disappointment. It's pricey and the food is mediocre with capital 'm'. I had a tasty crab bisque which had a heavy taste of old bay. It was serviceable salty and spicy. Not terrible. My friend had the shrimp and grits. Shrimp really over cooked as if it had been sitting around for a while. An expensive cocktail that was very sweet. I had salad with fried oysters, avocado, and bacon. Oysters were fine, hardly any avocado, and totally generic salad. This would all be fine but the food is truly expensive. A thousand better values in New Orleans than this place. Coffee was quite good. The French country decor was cool. however,  limited menu, sausage a little sweet, service a tad slow even when the place was not that busy. I was really looking forward to eating here after all the suggestions.  The mint julep and old fashioned were not horrible but definitely not great.  The hamburger looked amazing but lots of bread.  Bread pudding was sadly my least favorite I've had in NOLA.  Side note baked oysters amazing and nice staff. After reading about how great the happy hour was, we decided we needed to try Luke.  We were a group of 8, headed in at 3pm for happy hour.  The food and drinks were fine, but the service was the worse.  From snooty hostess to the chippy servers, we felt unwelcome.  These are snobby people working here, they seemed annoyed they had to serve us.  Never again. Great oyster happy hour. Some entrees are \"German\" inspired...  more like New Orleans food wearing a lederhosen.. Great apps though, hence the three stars. Oyster happy hour is great, food is awesome! But service needs to be improved...takes forever for someone to pour water, takes forever to get the check...low standard for a tourism city. An ok-experience, nothing to be missed.. We ordered- Chicken n waffles- meh, the meat was ok, waffles were soggy and extremely sweet. not worth the price at all. Shrimp n grits dish - pretty good Coffee - meh Best part was they accommodated couple of vegetarians in our party.. The server was very attentive and checked with the kitchen for options.. N everybody ended up with a decent breakfast.. Portions are small though.. You need a reservation .. service is pretty slow, even the coffee refills took forever. Food was good.  Tiny portions.  Service was severely lacking.  They are not quick.  Our food showed up roughly about an hour or more from time of order. Service was mediocre. Soup was great. Oyster salad was not good. It showed up cold and small for an entree salad. Not worth it. French 75 was great though. We ordered the raw oysters--they were huge, but very bland--and forgettable.  We heard great things about the chef, but can't attest to anything but the oysters.  Pass. Great expectations but didn't live up to it. I asked the waiter \"How do the soft-shell crabs look today?\" \"Excellent!\" was his reply. Well, that was the skinniest softshell crab I have ever seen, and it was undercooked to boot. The dish, softshell crab with poached eggs over grits topped with a hollandaise sauce sounded too decadent. And it was. The softshell should have made this dish over the top. Instead, the itsy bitsy, skinny, undercooked crab ruined it. How disappointing that I was led astray by the waiter. In all fairness, the kitchen was slammed, although they were aware of the crowd size as all had reservations. Others at my table got the crabmeat and asparagus omlet and was very pleased. Shrimp and grits tasty but small portion. Overall interesting place but will be a long time before I return, if ever. The prices make Besh's food more accessable.  The service is ok and the food, well it was good.  Normally I would expect more but given the price it is a good value.  Next time I'm going for happy hour and the raw bar instead of lunch. Ordered Shrimp and Grits.  Tasty, but the amount is about a small bowlful....for $22.  Salad was separate and uninspirational.    Gumbo shrimp and oyster was not fresh. Very disappointing for a John Besh restaurant. If you're a gal eating alone and DARE to make a reservation and get a table, be prepared to be ignored. I had to flag a hostess down to even order a drink. Food is good and worth a wait, but I am not sure it is worth being treated Luke a second class citizen. Hello, John Besh, are you listening?? How about you, Hilton hotels?? Had the gumbo; pretty average. Seafood in it was soggy and sort of mealy.  Small but decent bar. I did not realize it was part of the hotel but that didn't matter.  The atmosphere, at least in the front of the restaurant, was very authentic with tin ceiling, white tablecloths and comfortable chairs.  The oysters were fresh and wonderful - not briny, buttery,and large.  The brussel sprouts were to die for with a spicy vinaigrette, almonds and apple and as a bonus, they provided the recipe.  Crab and corn bisque was rich and very tasty. On the downside, our server was totally indifferent. Rushed us and when we could not decide on our main, she abruptly left us with the feeling we were not using her time wisely and then gave us cursory attention.  If you don't mind that service, the food is worth it.  I would not return however. Shrimp & grits was overpriced at $25. It tasted good, but the portion was small. The grits were cheesy.  The oysters on the half shell were a decent price. Half dozen for $9. They shuck fresh ones in front of you if you sit at the bar. Disappointing meal with slow service, average salad and dry fish. Came back to Lüke today expecting the pecan pancakes, but alas, they have changed the menu. I was disappointed but ordered the Croque Monsieur. The presentation of the sandwich was beautiful. It looked delicious. Maybe I didn't like the cheese or the texture, but I wasn't a fan. The French fries were good. The service was awesome, but I don't like the new brunch menu! Being a first timer in New Orleans, this place was high on the list of things to try. Unfortunately, it did not meet expectations.   Our waitress was rude and acted like we were dumb each time we asked a question about the menu. We also had trouble getting her to take our order in the first place. The bread was hard and tasteless. You could get better day old bread from Jimmy Johns.   We ordered the oysters. They had a funny taste to them, yet being hungry, we ate it anyway. Later on that night I had a bad reaction from them (I am not allergic, something was just off about them).   Do not recommend. great causal chic atmosphere and awesome service.  but the food was underwhelming and overpriced, small portions, and it seemed you could get better at the millions of other restaurants in the city. Inexplicably poor food and service.  I ordered the Luke Breakfast.  The coffee was weak. The grits were salty and lukewarm. The biscuit tasted like a pillsbury pop-out-of-the-can type. My poached egg had clear egg whites and was cold. Worst meal I've had in New Orleans. My wAitress, while sweet, was clueless about the menu and returned twice to correct herself. When I asked for cane syrup sausage brought me bacon, explaining that they only have andouille sausage, which is incorrect.  In addition, when I sent the dreck back no one inquired about what was the matter nor how to fix it. The rest of our party choked down their food. Love Willa Jean but this place was a miss.  ETA-- I spoke to management on the way out and the best they could offer was that they hoped we would try them again.  Zero stars. I've eaten at some amazing places in New Orleans. This was not one of them. The staff seemed flustered, it was loud, and the food was too salty to eat. Not a fan. Good food. Slow service though. Hard to get any waiters attention for service. Water refills? You literally have to walk to a waiter for service. Waiters, when you can see them, only focus on their tables. They need to scan the room more. Food was good but the service was off. Bread wasn't served until after we finished with our salads, although the beet salad was very good. And for dessert we watched our tasty ice cream melt on our bread pudding while waiting for utensils to eat with.  If they worked out the service issues it would be a four star. Also the place is noisy so not easy to carry on a conversation. My two friends and I ate here while in town on vacation. To be fair, one of my friends really enjoyed his food and it did look good. But my other friend and I ordered the crab BLT (something we would not have done if we'd overheard the server tell the table next to us to order something else - we'd already put our order in when this occurred). It was so incredibly salty that it was inedible. Neither of us could eat our meals. In hindsight, I should have sent them back although I hate making a fuss at a restaurant. But for $30-something, not being able to eat my dinner really stunk. Service other than that was great so it's a shame the food didn't live up to our expectations. Came here for their oyster happy hour, which is a great deal if you're looking to stock up on oysters. The raw oysters were good, and wasn't a huge fan of the fried ones. But didn't compare well to the delicious wood fire oven ones I had the day prior at Cochon (I know, it's not a fair comparison), so I walked away feeling a bit disappointed. Wouldn't make a special trip here unless I was craving a ton of raw oysters. Meh. Was expecting so much more. Most of the reviews rave about the fab oyster deal (not the full menu). Like others have said, service was mediocre. Might want to work on the layout (e.g. large bags of trash carried through main dining room???). Very good food, well presented. Cut the prices and we'd be sold. Came for breakfast but paid like it was dinner Appetizers were very good but my entree was mediocre and everything was a bit over-priced. Will not go back unless for happy hour and appetizers only. Solid food and expensive but the service here sucked ass.  They had 3 people on the hostess stand and 2 waiters with a half empty restaurant.  Not a great use of staff. So disappointed.   French fries were cold.   Our waitress ignores us.    I would not come back.   It is highly overrated I wish I could be dishonest, but I can't.  The service here is so atrocious that I'm perplexed beyond my wits. (the staff were arguing and cursing in front of me)  Does John Besh really own this place?   The food is good, eclectic pub food. The wait staff is hung-over, unkempt, and uninspired.  I'm sorry, but after 3 fair tries, I've made my final judgement.    The Burger was very good. Oysters were average. Shrimp and Grits was fine.  Review is mostly for the terrible service. Came here on a busy night and waited approximately 20 min after our reservation time, after showing up 20 min early.  Service 3 Food 4 Ambiance 3  Overall: 3.5 Stars  Had the foie gras which was good, but came with really hard garlic breadsticks, which did not go well with it. Also had some of their shrimp and shimp/grits dish.  Overall just did not feel welcome, or well taken care of compared to the other restaurants we visited on our trip. The food here is fine, particularly the oysters. It is a bit of a cliche though, modeled on a French brasserie, and from the looks of it, focus grouped and researched heavily to hit just the right demographic in the John Besh empire. But as a result, the restaurant has no soul. Food is executed well but without imagination, and the decor is generic. The faux-French posters and other decorations look like they came straight from Pier 1 Imports. There is something overly corporate about the whole experience. Went here on Thanksgiving, when I was not able to get a reservation at August.    I enjoyed my experience, but was not thrilled.  I liked the concept, German/French brasserie.  The food was comforting, and comfortably good, but not inspiring.    I ordered the shrimp farci, which disappointingly, was flash friend.  My companion had the shrimp and grits, which he enjoyed, and I'm told is one of their signature dishes. Looked over the menu and asked the waitress for suggestions. I was torn between a couple of options which is always good. I thought I should behave and leave room for later so I found an absolutely amazing healthy option!! Had the fritata with onions and peppers and it also has duck sausage with arugula and vinegrette with chuncks of feta cheese and pesto, tomatoes, and avocado. Comes with wheat toasts. It was pretty big so I was able to finish about 3/4 of it. I would have taken the rest home if I lived nearby. Overall good service and food came out pretty quickly. Went early in the morning to get a seat. Staff wear white coats so you know its fancy. From the pictures, they serve a lot of oysters here but I did not get any whiff of fish smell which pleases me. This review is based on service. Horrible service for our large party with reservation. It took over an hour to get our entrees and they messed up many orders. Jumbo shrimp dish was a joke. I do not recommend. The food varied from excellent (baked oysters) to inedible (profiteroles) with our entrees somewhere in between as just average. The service was off - not exactly slow, but just weird. The food, atmosphere, and service were all underwhelming for the price. If you want to try a Besh restaurant I would highly recommend Domenica instead. SO disappointed after seeing all the good reviews! Came here for breakfast while visiting NOLA and was very let down.  The biscuits were really dry and heavy, and even the eggs tasted off.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone, at least not for breakfast. The setting and the servers are really nice. We really enjoyed our soups as starters although they were tiny. But the beet salad I had was soggy with dressing and they put the cheese on the bottom of the bowl on purpose (because it was so strange I asked). I didn't realize that when we paid $13 for crab meat it was going to be lathered in cream. My boyfriend found a long dark hair in his food halfway through his burger. The manager came over and apologized, still left the burger on the table as if he was still going to eat it. She proceeded to bring out a free dessert that we neither asked for, nor really wanted. When the bill came they had very graciously taken off the $7 coffee cup sized, little bowl of soup. Would never go back. It was ludicrously overpriced. I had a terrible experience here on thanksgiving day. I was anticipating a fine dining experience but it was the worst. The service was poor and the food horrible. The people next to me sent their food back also. I ordered a lame version of turducken which was completely dry. The stuffing on the side was watery and soggy. The greens were so salty I had to spit it out. The waiters came to our table only twice in the evening. When they saw my untouched plate, the waiter just looked at it and took it away with out asking how everything was. They gave us some hard bread about 30 minutes after we got there. Poor poor poor. Luke is great for happy hour and dessert. For dinner there are other restaurants in the quarter that are better that have a similar cuisine and price. Service wasn't great. The food was pretty good, but not nearly as good as August! So, we were told there was a two hour wait, stepped outside, made an Open Table reservation and where then immediately seated. Had fun waltzing back in to the same woman, looking her in the eye and saying. \"We have a reservation\".   The highlights were happy hour 75 cent oysters and half price wine along with great service from Maddie and Kenny. The pate was great and generous.   Lowlights. Crab and tuna appetizers were great, but tiny portions for $15. Did not order any entrees because I'm not a tourist and won't pay $28 for a soft shell crab sandwich or boiled shrimp. Spent nearly $100 and left hungry. Neat atmosphere, good price on raw oysters for happy hour, limited seating, touristy close to bourbon, I wouldn't seek out again Not happy, the wait to get served was about 15mins to just order a drink, then they took another 10mins to come take our order, then the waiter comes back to tell me it would be an hour for them to get me six oysters because of happy hour. not for nothing the customer who is paying full price should be the priority versus the happy hour customer. I am a fan of August. Luke is good but to me it's more of a burger, oyster or  breakfast place. It is not a destination restaurant in my opinion. There are places I would rather go, but if you are staying in the hotel, or live in the CBD,  it would be convenient. I was disappointed with my dinner at Luke.  I was eating solo on a Sunday night, so I sat at the bar.  The vibe was great, but most of the food was poor.  I enjoyed the Salad Luke, but the market (Drumfish) fish meuniere was awful.  It was basically an oily, fried piece of fish that lacked flavor except for the heavy dose of salt - that also permeated the accompanying vegetables.  And it seemed as though the Crispy Brussels Sprouts were prepared in the same manner.  Yes, I expected them to be fried, but these were drenched in oil and doused with salt.  I was really not happy and left more than half of each dish.  I chose not to waste time with dessert.  The service was very good. Very disappointed... waited extremely long to order drinks... ordered appetizers and one plate came out with hair and waiter acted like no big deal... finished and left!!! Horrible. We were staying at the hilton and stopped here because we were starving at 9 pm. I used to serve tables and rarely complain about service but...  Our waitress forgot to put our order in the computer ( I know because 45 minutes the first time she came back, asked for our order again and proceeded back to punch into the computer). When food finally arrived an hour and a half after walking in, it was tasteless. How do you make Cajun food tasteless in New Orleans. Thanks to Luke, I now know that every restaurant in NOLA isn't amazing. I was starting to wonder since all of my other dining experiences have been amazing here. I am torn on this review as the food is awesome both at this location as well as the San Antonio, TX location and i think Besh is great.    The issue I have is that the server was a complete asshat.  I am a very positive person and will rarely call someone out on the Internet (in person where they have a chance to defend their self is more my style). this was rude to my mother and cut her off mid order then proceeded to act like a prick to my sister-in-law.  I will most likely visit other locations or other Besh restaurants instead of  this one in the future. Very disappointed in the service as well as the food.  Our first night in New Orleans Luke was recommended by the hotel . Lamb was rubbery and tasteless.  Pork was over done. Adding salt didn't even help the taste .  Will not get a second chance . Food is not good. We ordered Fois Gras and the toasted bread along with it came cold and old. Roasted chicken dish was oily and not tasty at all.  One good thing about the place is service, but I won't come back for that. I ordered the Étouffee of blue crab & brown shrimp, my friend ordered shrimp and grits. We came when drinks were have off (SCORE!) so ordered a sazerac and riverbend...sazerac was super strong! I thought the food was really solid. The etouffee had so much flavor and the crab was fantastic..really fresh tasting and freshly made pasta. Shrimp and grits was really tasty and had a nice spice to it. I'm taking off a few points for the service which was really bad. By the time we got seated it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order or even acknowledge us even though the servers past us by at least 10 times. Went here the first night we were in town.   Was not expecting the casual atmosphere, but very much appreciated it as we were so beat from traveling.  We had made a reservation, but it was Monday night and New Orleans seems to be sleeping in the beginning of the week and wakes up as you advance in days.  We loved the Flamenkuche, which was like a flatbread with onions and bacon.  Very tasty.  Very much liked the croque madame, cooked crispy and the fries were salty and plentiful.  But in my opinion if you know what a Jewish matzo ball soup tastes like, then you will want to skip onto some other choice on the menu.  I'd go back, but it might take awhile to go through all the other restaurants in town. The pancakes were on point. The pecan butter in them excellent. A little pricey though for breakfast 3 - okay service 4 - food 3 - New Orleans opportunity cost when there is K-Paul's and others that are very New Orleans  Great food fun but too many places that are better. American Sector is a better value and also a Besh restaurant. They refused to seat us despite having a reservation.  We stopped by Luke at 5 pm today for happy hour. Upon entering, we were told that they were booked up for the evening as a result of the St. Patrick's Day parade. So, we stepped over to the bar to look for a seat and also went onto Open Table to see if there were reservations available. We were in luck! There was a reservation at 5:15, which we promptly booked. When we returned to the hostess stand, they told us that they weren't honoring Open Table reservations. Why be on Open Table then?   This is not the first time they have pretended to be fully booked when trying to walk in. Last time at least they honored the reservation. Not a huge fan of this place.  I've been all over New Orleans, but didn't think the restaurant was worth the price.   1.  We got the fried oyster, avocado salad.  It was incredibly overdressed, to the point of soggy leaves at the end.  But good flavor. 2.  I got the gumbo, yummy but not dissimilar to more affordable places 3.  burger, good but not amazing.  Fries were a bit cold and had to ask for a new side.  They weren't crispy either, a little soggy. What was the strangest thing was that it was really difficult to get a reservation, but when we went--the restaurant wasn't full! Came here for happy hour for half off cocktails (delicious), $1.25 fried oysters (best I've ever had) and less than a dollar for raw oysters! You get the local P and J oysters for the happy hour oysters, which are quite unflavorful and full of oyster shell pieces from shucking. Can't really complain though because for less than a buck a shuck it's still a steal!   I would have given perfect star review had it not been for the strand of hair embedded/cooked into our crawfish.... kind of ruined the moment of a superb meal. We couldn't even just pick it off because it was so cooked into the crawfish! Also, no one even came by to ask how our meal was or if we needed anything else, so we never got to show them the hair-wrapped crawfish. Had crawfish bisque,  gumbo, chicken and biscuit,  and shrimp and grits.   Ive never been a fan of bisque but theirs was very good. Their gumbo was just as delicious but a little too much okra. But thats where it ends. Chicken and biscuit with honey sauce was overly sweet and greasy. Shrimp and grits were salty. Looked great but failed on taste. Ate Xmas dinner at Luke with my wife. We were made to sit at the bar though a good amount of tables were empty the whole time we were there. Horrible service at the bar. Both of our meals came out undercooked (burger and mussels).    I've had a decent lunch there in the past, but won't be going back. + food was delicious (when we finally got it!) and good drinks and beer. Prices are great during happy hour.   - however, the service was pretty bad. orders were forgotten and took more than an hour to get an order of fries (which I had to send back b/c they weren't fried enough!). Good thing they gave us our drinks before they forgot so at least we had something to keep ourselves occupied. I have added a star to the review for the restaurant reaching out to ask about my experience.  Any restaurant that is looking to improve its customer experience deserves a second look - the next time I am in New Orleans I will do so. I ordered the ribeye and it wasn't anything too exciting. Don't get me wrong, it was good but definitely something I could've cooked at home minus the $34. My waitress was also very pushy and seemed to be in such a rush to get my mom and I out of the restaurant. One time stop only Breakfast. The breakfast sandwich is actually a breakfast burger. The shrimp and grits is creamy, well seasoned and delicious. Come hungry if you choose to spend some dough on your first meal of the day. Went to eat from the bar but service was non existent. There was a tender and oyster chucker guy but after getting a glass of wine they were not to be found.  I hung on another 20 min without service and went elsewhere.  They really need better service.  But ... Since im staying at the hilton and its a hundred degrees out I came back a few days later.  Had some coffee and vanilla cake.  Cake was five stars.  But \"fresh\" blueberries were still thawing out.  Service at the bar was a bit better but still slow. Not worth the hype. The prices are higher than other places and the food is ok had better. Nice ambiance however the service was poor. The servers seem to have a bit of an attitude and not fully understand the meaning of good customer service. During happy hour, this place gets 4 stars.  With $0.50 oysters there really is nothing to complain about.  I have also eaten here twice during non happy hour (once for lunch and once for dinner).  I got the burger one time and the croque madame the other time.  The burger was pretty tasty.  The croque madame was good as well, but both seem overpriced for what they were. The meals come with small condiments which were a nice touch. After all my rave reviews of LUKE I finally had a subpar meal. On a previous Sunday I was here with a friend who ordered the house special veal dish. He was raving about how good it was so I decided to order it myself. I really was disappointed this time as the veal was overcooked and stringy. The gravy did not have the flavor that my friend had previously either. I was very disappointed by this dish.  We also had the happy hour oysters and cocktails which were great. I guess no place can be great everyday. We put in our order 50 minutes ago. We ordered the burrata salad, shrimp and grits, crispy Brussels sprouts, and flammenkuchen. We asked our waiter to bring the plates as they were ready. 50 minutes and nothing has come out. AND ITS MY BIRTHDAY. To top it off the staff just seemed annoyed that we mentioned we were hungry. They brought over two more rolls.  I don't want to get full on bread.   Our waiter did give us two glasses of champagne after he saw my hangry face. Luke is a let down compared to Besh's other restaurants. The food is german diner style with seafood? I am confused. The happy hour on raw oysters is pretty good, but how hard is it to serve food you literally don't cook... Wow. So disappointed as it was the first John Besh restaurant I tried and it didn't meet any of my expectations at all.  None of the food was memorable, in fact, some of it was simply bad. The frites came out cold and instead of replacing them they tried to re-fry them into brown sticks of starch - ugh.  The bartender didn't know how to serve pastis - in a French Brasserie?  Food was cold or delayed. The server forgot drinks. And, nothing tasted great.   Sadly, there are too many other good restaurants in NOLA I would try again before here. Damn, I really like John Besh, too. Disinterested service. Slow food preparation. Food was good but not great. Looks like besh set this place up and has never come back. The food was good but not great.  A bit overpriced for the food and the lack of atmosphere.  Also, when we were there on a rather busy night, it felt very chain-like.  Still, I'd give it another shot and go between 3-6 for the oysters. The oysters were great and the service good. However the schnitzel and side dishes were small.  We talked to the water but he charged us for another side dish. The red cabbage was not very tasty, not enough gravy and the spatzle Were at a premium . Overall it was just ok. Go for the oysters. Poor quality Sunday breakfast/brunch service for a messily party of 3. Would have liked to try the food, but we couldn't even get served water within 20 minutes so we left. Won't be returning for sure. Went to Palace Cafe instead (which I highly recommend for Sunday brunch). I popped by Luke for the simple reason of hitting them for their HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL - $0.75 oyster, $1.25 fried oysters and half off drinks 3-6pm Everyday.  I just wanted a couple of the fried oysters, but was told that they come by the half dozen.  Okay, that's fine.  They arrived in a cute fry basket, and down they went way too easily. This pertains to breakfast only:  The one time I've had breakfast here, it wasn't anything special.  I would have been happier with Waffle House.  I'm not saying it was bad.  Given some level of expectation, it should have been somewhat better than an average breakfast offering. The service was very good. The food was yummy, but a bit salty. I enjoyed this restaurant and would go again but was no my favorite in New Orleans where there are so many good restaurants! Breakfast was tasty, but it didn't blow me away. Service was great and atmosphere was attractive, upscale and clean. They lost 2 stars due to price. I felt they were priced for convenience of the hotels rather than trying to be competitive with other restaurants.   I heard they have a decent happy hour, but after breakfast being so pricey, we didn't go back. Had breakfast.  Average french press coffee, wife got yogurt and granola which was overpriced for $12. I got the egg white fritata which was excellent.  Overall I would want to come back but restaurant was average on this visit. I was seriously disappointed with the quality of food and service at this location. The waiter didn't tell us about the happy hour specials and we had to wait 20-30 minutes for them to pack our left over food and get a check.   My gf tried shrimp with grits which was good but not worth $24. Crab bisque was the main highlight. My burger was alright, nothing to separate it from a Chillis burger and fires were stale.   Overall, this is a very pricy place ($$$) with a very mediocre quality food and service. They do have happy hour but they won't tell u about it. I'm not sure why are there so many positive reviews, I think u can do lot better at other places. I had the Monday special, a fried pork chop with polenta and wilted greens. The wilted greens are the southern kind...bitter and vaguely smoky.  They serve the mains in these cast iron camp dishes.  We also had the roasted beet salad and a cup of mozzo ball soup to share.  All of this was good but HEAVY.  I felt sort of dizzy after. That might also have something to do with the fact that this was one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to in my life. My bf was a big fan of the windowed kitchen...he was rapt in his man-crushes on all the chefs working the line. Lots of flame-cooked stuff in there. Romantic this dinner was not. The experience overall was very disappointing. I ordered the entouffee and the dish was very salty and could not finish even half of it. The oysters were fresh and large in size.   The service was unsatisfactory. The restaurant was not busy but we were seated near the door next to a really loud table. service nor food not up to New Orleans standards. our waiter was nice but everyone else was surley. you can get just as good breakfast for less Highlights of the menu:  The burger - huge and comes with house made fries Croque monsieur/madame - high end ham& cheese (spring for the egg on top) Pate of Rabbit and Duck livers - the flavors complement each other perfectly The maple sausage served in the Southern breakfast Shrimp and Grits - the grits are a revelation (though the portion is small)  A great stop for breakfast, lunch or happy hour - I wouldn't waste a coveted dinner spot since there are better Besh spots. Just tried this place based on the past reviews and I have to say I am sadly disappointed. It wasn't the service that was the issue is was more the quality of the food. We tried the foie gras and there were more ingredients added (slight balsamic reduction and a gelatin that tasted like lychee) to it that one couldn't even taste or appreciate it. My wife had the entrecôte (ribeye) and I had the canard roti. Unfortunately the duck wasn't very palatable and was over seasoned and the skin was rubbery. The ribeye was adequate but nothing special. I sadly can not recommend this place. Food was ok but not the same for service, it took forever for me to be seated despite the fact that there were several empty tables available. Easily worst gumbo of my life.  Service was pretty poor too.  This place is supposed to to be fancy but you can find better almost anywhere on bourbon street.  DONT EAT HERE!!! Worst experience I've had in a restaurant in my entire life. Staff were rude from the moment we walked in the door. Obviously has just become a tourist trap where they no longer care about delivering customer service. Wine list is horrible. Enjoyed the pate appetizer but that was about it All we wanted were some good happy hour oysters. Takes way too long for naked oysters. Better off going somewhere else Service can be spotty - Don't let them out you in the back- the whole point of a bistro  is to have a bistro experience. great Happy Hour- and French 75s Disappointed that 5 minutes after we entered, I was told to not laugh as loud while sitting at the bar. It's 9pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant is half full. Not a positive atmosphere. The food was delicious. The service was mediocre.   The crawfish bisque was the highlight of the dinner. I ordered the bowl portion size and received the cup portion size. However, the owner gave me the correct portion in compliment with the cup size. The bisque had very great flavor and a nice after kick of spice!     I had the $16 burger and it was flawless! However, the condiments came in small glass bottles. It would have been more feasible to have regular bottles for condiments, as it was frustrating trying to get ketchup from the small bottles. Literally worse service I have ever had at an upscale restaurant. They lost our order, brought wrong food, brought right food cooked wrong, and then manger was rude. We will never ever go back and never recommend it. Only reason for 2 stars was a decent steak my boyfriend had. I don't think I'll return to Luke.  The boiled shrimp were over-cooked; the white wine was only slightly chilled (needed ice); and the seafood gumbo, while tasty, was overloaded with okra and sausage...too many other better options in this city. We came here for the oyster happy hour, and I think that's the only thing this place is really good for. I had gotten half a dozen raw and half a dozen fried. Both were good. However, any of their other food is generic and forgettable. For the price of the happy hour, the place is not bad, oysters were fine (I think I preferred the fried, though usually raw is my jam), and the drinks were strong enough. However, I didn't care much for the gruff persona of our server, or how quickly they would disappear. We weirdly had two servers, yet somehow it was hard to flag either down. It's not on my return list, but I wouldn't say no if others wanted to go. The oyster happy hour is one if the best I have ever encountered. But I will never get over the hydrogenated oil in the pancakes or baked goods but the oysters have etched a place in me heart forever! I think they are the best I have tried in town and for the price how can u go wrong! Just get they freakin hydrogenated oil out of the pancakes and baked goods  and maybe I would do breakfast here! Because of that I give Luke's 3 stars instead of 5. Hate corner cutters even if you ply me with delectable oysters. It was good however when you order medium be ready for medium rare on the ribeye.  All and all it was OK Hello. Just a heads up about our visit this morning for brunch.   The hostess was on her cell phone when we arrived.  We had to wait for her to finish her text before we got greeted.  At that time she seemed annoyed that she had to take care of us.  This in turn set a negative tone for our visit.  I saw her on her phone while others arrived as well.  I am shocked by the lack of professionalism at a well established restaurant.  While I won't be back, I thought this needed to be shared.  The food was decent- the housemade sausage was the best thing we had. When I first called to get reservations the young lady told me there was no room for reservations until 1030. We decided to walk just to check it out and when we got here they had an empty table for 4.    We looked at the menu and we were not excited with the menu. I was excited to try some of the previously posted item but to my demise they were not available. We did try some of the appetizers and drinks.   I had the Bee in your Bonnet: not bad and would recommend it. Also had the Brussel sprouts and the au gratin which was good but not orgasmic.   Overall, it can be skipped. Was looking forward to eating here, was not easy to get a reservation. I had the hamburger, it was cooked perfectly however the flavor was lacking. Service was good. This place was a tough one for me!  On one hand, the food was fantastic.  The drink/food specials for happy hour was great, but the service, was lackluster.  We sat for some time waiting for water refills, drinks, and the food.  The food that came was wrong, although corrected quickly.  I do have to say, the Brussel Sprouts were some of the best I've ever eaten.  I may actually dream about them :).  Also, I feel like there is a time when the drinks can get \"too fancy\" where they end up tasting like cologne/perfume.  Regardless, with so many options in New Orleans for amazing food, you may want to keep walking. Meh. Wasn't bad, wasn't great.  From the reviews I read I was expecting to have my socks knocked off.   I had the fried chicken honey Tabasco biscuit + chicken was cooked nicely + the sweetness was wonderful -biscuit was dry - the grits that were served with it were not good. They were cold and gloopy  Husband had the crab omelette. He said it was good but not great. The fries they served with the omelette were great. Best thing we ate there. Nice think and crispy.   We did have great service though. We were just not impressed with the food. Great atmosphere. Enjoyed the baked oysters. Pricey. Sat at the bar, not so friendly bartender. But the black guy who shucks oysters was fantastic! Such a great smile and energy. He suggested the baked oysters and even had the kitchen send out two soups for us to try. Wished he was getting our tip instead. Arrived at Luke's late in the evening on Christmas day. Not sure if it was an off day for them, or if we had arrived too late, but for a restaurant with four stars on Yelp, it was sadly very disappointing!   We wanted the special of the day, which they had run out of, and settled instead for the fresh gulf fish and a bowl of gumbo.  The gulf fish was okay, but nothing to write home about. The gumbo was by far the most disappointing -- it came lukewarm at best, which quickly turned to cold. Also, the gumbo lacked any discernible seafood and instead was filled with sausages?   It was a disappointing start to our food adventures in New Orleans, but luckily the exception rather than the norm. Absolutely awful customer service. Had a 2:30 reservation and was told we had to be out by 4:30 for a large party. Service was extremely slow and food was average. Don't waste your money. First restaurant in New Orleans.  The seafood soup was tasty.  The shrimp and grits was good as well.  My burger was salty and the fries were \"over fried\".  Thought about complaining but didn't.  Service wasn't great but our server was responsive when he was around.  He did end up trying to give me more fries after giving us the check. The food was fair, wait staff nice but service was poor and it is quite expensive. I liked Luke but I was not blown away.  I think my friend liked it more than I did.  The food was good but, with one exception, nothing overly special.  The exception was the P&J oysters which were absolutely fantastic.  If I were to go back, I would make this my meal.  Unfortunately, the shrimp and grits were average and not nearly as good as I have had elsewhere.  And the vanilla cake was really nothing more than a basic pound cake.  The atmosphere is a really cool, which I did not expect as a restaurant located in the first floor of a major chain hotel.  Unfortunately, given all the great food options in a city like New Orleans, Luke is really quite average and I would have a hard time justifying going back. I'll make this short and sweet  Happy Hour Oysters - good deal   Our waitress - a super bi***** who had major attitude and was irritated that we only ordered 2 dozen oysters and nothing else. She gave some major attitude and was tooo sassy for my taste. This is the main reason this place gets two stars. Service is important! She needs to take a class! We went back and were treated by the restaurant. The server, Chris was fantastic. We were in the back area where it was a much more enjoyable experience. The food was also done perfectly. Thanks. 4 Stars for service.  Staff wasn't pushy, went the extra mile, relaxed but attentive and professional.  Pate of Louisiana Rabbit & Chicken livers  perfumed with truffles  country bread croutons  10.00  Great Appetizer, reasonable price.  Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp  \"En CoCotte\"  McEwen & Sons' creamy  white corn grits & Poche's andouille  22.00  Tasted good but overpriced. Shrimp and grits for $22.00, come on...  Luke Burger Allan Benton's bacon, caramelized  onions, tomatoes, Emmenthaler Swiss  cheese with house-made fries  16.50  Good but not great.  Really enjoyed the French 75 cocktail.  Casual atmosphere, cool decor, great service, a bit pricey, kinda loud. The food was quite disappointing, but the atmosphere and presentation were good.  Staff was attentive. The crab-stuffed shrimp entree had 4 smallish shrimp, with a ball of stuff around each (with no - at least, no apparent  - crab).  The fish entree (meuniere) was incredibly salty.  We ordered house pinot grigo; the wine was not very good; when we got the bill, we learned that the waiter had served us $12 glasses of riesling (note: wine is served in juice glasses).  The side of asparagus contained pieces of asparagus, rather than spears, served in a soup-cup bowl. The veggies served with the entrees were good.  I would never go back.  The J.W. Marriott staff should stop recommending this restaurant. I expected nothing short of fabulous. I ordered the Luke Salad with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat as an addition. Sadly I had to pick some black leaves out of the greens and the crabmeat was nowhere near jumbo lump. Extremely disappointed. I really hate to say anything bad about this place because I know people who work there, but this is one of the most overrated restaurants in the city. This place has got to be kept alive by tourists who don't know any better. The building, of course, is beautiful, the service is great, but the food? No. Go elsewhere. Went in to make a reservation, was told that the wait was 2 hour and that they would text us when the reservation was ready. That was perfectly fine. As we grew more hungry, hour 3 came around, still no text saying that our table was ready. We called in asking if there was a table available, the lady rudely snuffed it off saying that we should have stayed in the area. Guess service wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. Here's what you need to know: oysters from the Gulf are nothing like the oysters you're used to getting from the East or West Coasts. They don't have the same complexity, the same salinity. They're still good, but they're especially good deep fried in the batter that Lüke uses for their fried oysters. Head that way for happy hour and see what I mean. Happy hour here is a great deal! Cocktails were just ok but half off. Oysters were similarly just ok but 75 cents. The crab gratin was tasty, cheesy, and creamy. If you like gulf oysters and cheap drinks, stop by during happy hour. As we were visiting NOLA for the first time we wanted to have a great dining experience. Luke's was sadly lacking. The menu was not interesting or innovative. The dinner arrived cold and the server was too busy to check in with us. If you plan on The best part of our meal was the outstanding Oysters, which were Kumoto and from the west coast. We should have saved our money for dining in San Francisco.  Do not recommend this place for a great dining experience. We went there around 9 pm on Saturday without reservation. We stopped at this restaurant on the way back to our hotel. I ordered seafood gumbo, which was tasty, maybe a bit salty, and it didn't have any seafood in it except some shrimp. The service was awful. Once we were seated, nobody came to our table except taking our order and delivering out food. Other tables were getting all the attentions. I don't know whether we didn't order expensive food, or we arrived late, or we dressed casually. But we were complete ignored. I can see that their food is good, but I don't think I want to come back to this place again. Mixed review here. We ate with a group of 10. Service was awesome. Most of the food was incredible. The shrimp etouffee had enough salt to turn the Great Lakes into oceans. The grits and Flammkuchen was to-die-for good. Creamy grits. Giant burgers. Oysters fine. Pretty good burgers, sometimes a little overdone. Good fries.  My husband loves the gumbo.  Everything else is ok.  Bc it is in the CBD, it can be a pain to park at.  And it's pretty expensive. Burger and fries will run about $16. Awful. I ordered a bowl of muscles. More than half were undercooked. including the ones that were open. They also weren't properly cleaned and the entire bowl was grainy. Only reason it deserves a star is because of the fries. My wife and I just stopped here to try to get dessert. They had a bunch of tables open as well as seats at the bar. Somehow they wouldn't be able to seat us, but had tables open for reservation when we checked online after leaving. All we wanted was bread pudding :( Okay at best....far better choices in NOLA!   Shrimp & grits was good but tiny!!!  I have had this dish in many places and this was by far the smallest.  The girl who waited on us had a huge attitude...Shawn.  Pretty much gave us the impression that she did not care at all about if we were satisfied or not. Food is very fresh and delicious, and service was quite poor, which lowered our rating. Fruits de mer was good and a very nice selection with excellent jumbo Gulf shrimp. Brussels sprouts tasty but over priced, chowder exquisite.  Bread pudding light and rich. Hard to find service people on a Thursday night. Our server was really great and the food was pretty tasty as well. The reason why I'm giving it three stars out of five is because the ambiance was very loud. They have a cabinet next to the hostess stand which holds all of their silverware and about every five minutes you'd hear ridiculously loud noises of forks,spoons,etc. being dropped on the floor or being thrown into a drawer in the cabinet. I know it might sound petty but it's really annoying when you're trying to hold a conversation with someone. Dinner @ Lukes was a total disappointment.  Bad Yelp -  you lead me astray!  Even though we had a reservation, we were stuck at a small corner table near 2 large corporate dinners so it was very loud. The atmosphere was average.   The menu did not have all that many options so I settled on the shrimp and grits which was too spicy, a small portion and not all that great.  I forget what my husband had but he was equally disappointed.  Service was inattentive and slow.    NOT Recommended Tried for a second time to eat this place. Both times I never received my food. the first time was 60 minutes of waiting for my order which I never received. The second time was 90 minutes. This time they simply forgot to make it. Organization at this place is not existent. attitude is equally as bad. On a side note...avoid the Hilton Hotel it is attached to as well.   I've ate here last and it was adequate. Staff was rude but the food was okay. Staff is still rude. Food? Avoid this joint at all cost. Doesn't state anywhere that reservations are highly recommended! Arrived at 5 & was told next available seating was 8pm?! Unbelievable! Ready to spend $100s! I have been here for lunch and dinner. Very casual.  Small winelist, but lots of good stuff. Try the daily specials. The redfish and brisket specials are fantastic. Located in the Hilton which requires they are open 365.  Also try the crab salad and stuffed shrimp with orange hollandaise. Amazing sandwiches at lunch. My wife had a softshell crab blt that was enormous.  This place is slipping. Service has gotten slow. Good location but not great food for breakfast I went to Luke based on great reviews of it for dinner. I didn't experience great food for breakfast, however. I ordered a standard breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, and a biscuit. The food was very bland, and the biscuit didn't come with jam or butter until I asked for it. Otherwise the service was rapid, and the waiter was nice. If you're looking for a good breakfast, try elsewhere. Clean, simple atmosphere. Let's the architecture speak for itself. The military plaques hung behind the bar are crooked and misaligned as if haphazardly placed in a rush before an uncle came to visit, expecting to see his honors displayed. Other than that, it's pretty to look at.   Crab bisque is AMAZING! Our appetizer took an insane amount of time, so they threw in a few free cups of bisque. It was the only thing we didn't actually order, and it was by by far best thing we tasted.   Bartender was great- warm, nice, helpful. We'd definitely go back if it wasn't so unbelievable crowded all the time. I was here last week for breakfast. The food was good. My mother loved the pancakes with berry cane syrup. I had the southern breakfast, with the cane syrup sausage, which were delicious.           However, the service was terrible. Our sever was very nice, but he seemed to be the only server for the entire dining room. It took almost half an hour just to get a coffee refill. There were several people in server outfits just standing around. We asked one of them to bring water for the table, but it never came. I would give this place another try based on the food, but there are too many good restaurants in New Orleans to waste time and money on bad service. I ordered the LÜKE BREAKFAST:  TWO EGGS COOKED ANY STYLE, BACON, HOUSE-MADE ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE, BUTTERMILK BISCUIT GRITS.  It was so rich that I was sick for two days. The bacon looked like it was deep fried which I have never seen before. The sausage did not taste like andouille. I didn't eat it.   I would not recommend. As my first John Besh restaurant, Lüke left me a bit underwhelmed. I went with my co workers who had always said great things about the restaurant. I went with the red fish, which was good, but not something better than a fish dish you might get at a chain like Cheesecake Factory. My colleague got the roasted chicken which actually looked amazing, and will be my choice should we return.  Ambiance was simple but nice. Service was attentive, but nothing spectacular. Bottom line, Lüke is a good restaurant, but with so many other great restaurants in the area, it doesn't seem to stand out to me. \"Pearl\" in the 19$ dollar oysters. Sounds like a good deal! If you are a high fan of \"pearls\", please come here and try their oysters! 4 out of 6 times you will find a \"pearl\"! Good luck have fun! Good things: 1) As with many of the John Besh restaurants, this place has a great happy hour 2) Good oysters  We go here for happy hour pretty often, as they have 1/2 beer, wine, and specialty cocktails, along with 50 cent oysters. And they are the good, briney, yummy oysters! I would recommend the happy hour to anyone and everyone.   Since its near where I work, Ive also been there for a few \"fancy\" lunches for celebrations. The food is pretty good, its just not my favorite in the area for the category of \"fancy lunch\". Went for Happy Hour!! Great prices, but couldn't enjoy after spending the last 3 nights in New Orleans. Oysters were huge and we both had the shrimp and grits. It was really heavy, but tasty!! I would definitely try something else next time. The good...Calvin, and Dave were excellent servers! The Shrimp and Grits....extremely salty, but I was hungry so choked them down with two very good draft IPA's. My friend had the fried oysters,  but had to be sent back since they were overcooked, chewy and dry. They brought her out some more, which were somewhat better. Dessert, the Hummingbird cake was bland and dry, very disappointing. Sent it back in exchange for the bread pudding, which was very good. Excellent staff, friendly, great service. Will not be dining here again though. I will go to the tried and true, Mr. B's for their BBQ shrimp, or any other establishments that do not over salt their food. The food here is good but compare to Nola standard I think this place mediocre, a 3 star and not 4. There are many other restaurant in this area that offer better items on their menu Didn't even get to sit. The place was half empty when we came with a party of 8 (bachelor's party). We were in sports gear for our bike tour after brunch.  Hostess proceeded to inform us they can't take a party of 8. When I asked if she can split us into parties of 4, she had a peculiar look and proceeded to let us know, politely, that she's \"actually\" all booked through Mardi Gras and can't take walk ins.  -.-\"    Not sure if it's the dress code or our ethnicity, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt and assume the former.   If there was a strict dress code, they should've been upfront with it.   It goes without saying that we were a group of polite professionals with two officers with us Came for happy hour specials, Oysters were small and Fried oysters my daughter had were even smaller and noting special.  Place was nice and service was good. I gave them it a three because ultimately. I come for the food. The food was good but overall the experience was average.  I ordered the shrimp and grits with lump crab and it was good. It had a nice flavor cajun that wasn't too spicy,  cooked in lots of butter but honestly the grits were my favorite part?!  The boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles.  On their own the chicken and waffles were okay but overall I was not a fan.  The syrup had a weird sweet, licorice flavor to it and was really unpleasant but my boyfriend loved it so, who knows?! I came here for dinner about 8 years ago and then went back for a brunch earlier this year.  Both times were enjoyable, but the food was a little rich for my tummy.  Food was a little on the pricey side for what you get. I did find it a tad loud, so it was a challenge to hear the other people at my table talking.  All in all, I would come back to give it another try, and hope for a better experience. Menu is ho-hum, especially for the price. I made the mistake of ordering this onion tart that reminded me of a bbq chicken pizza from CPK. Should've picked up that the waiter wasn't as enthused when I ordered but didn't dissuade me (too subtle for me at the time, but understandable behavior from him). Gezellig sfeervol restaurant met aardige bediening. Flamenkuche was koud bij het opdienen. De openkeuken liet ons zien dat hij opnieuw de oven inging en hierna droog was. Ander hoofgerecht bleek iets anders te zijn dan besteld. Voor ons dus een tegenvaller. Als \"compensatie\" werd hoofdgerecht en drankjes niet in rekening gebracht Disappointing.  We went for brunch on a Saturday after reading some good reviews here.  The food was ok but overpriced for what it was, especially a dozen TINY West Coast oysters for $45. But the real issue here was the service or the lack there of.  We had to chase the waiter down several times to refill water glasses and to find out why 1 appetizer came out right away but we waited 10 minutes for the oysters and Bloody Mary's.  Burgers were ordered rare and medium but came out well with cold fries. We assume the problem was the burgers were cooked before the appetizers were even delivered to the table.  Overall, can't recommend when there are so many better options in New Orleans! The Roasted Beet salad was great. I got the entrecote grille au frites . They served the wrong sauce with the steak, although good not what I asked for, cooked perfect though. The fries were cold within minutes of service. The beer selection was unique, I got Belgium ale that was great.  I would give it another try the next time I'm in New Orleans. While the service was good, the shrimp and grits were just ok. This is an upscale restaraunt, if you want good shrimp in grits, I would suggest you go elsewhere While the food was ok, I am not accustomed to begging for a coffee refill. I do not like being treated as if I am invisible. Food...excellent.  Service, extremely subpar for such a highly-rated establishment.  Service in need of repair. Last night, I ordered Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" at Luke. After the first bite, I could tell the shrimp was mushy. But I didn't believe that a highly rated restaurant and a $25 dish would serve shrimps that were not fresh. I still finished my dinner. One hour later, I got rashes on my whole body and it was very itchy. It happens when I eat bad shrimps and I need to take an allergy pill to relieve it. I feel deeply disappointed with this restaurant. Will never go back again. Lively atmosphere and very friendly bartender. $0.50 cent oysters during happy hour. This restaurant disappointed - given it has 4 stars on Yelp and $$. It should really be 3 stars and $$$. Really too expensive for what you get. I was glad they were open on xmas, but that meant a more expensive menu with even less choice. The shrimp and grits was pretty tasty, as were the mussels, but other things disappointed. The worst offender was the Bibb lettuce salad (not sure how they messed up a salad, but they did) and the overly salty french fries. And the matzoh ball soup was just awful - but then again, why did I order that at a french brasserie? Probably because it was 30 degrees underneath the A/C (which they claimed they couldn't turn down because it's controlled by the hotel they are in). Breakfast this morning -- mediocre.  Restaurant was dark and smelly.  Eggs were cold.  Coffee lukewarm at best.  The morning at Luke has cast a pall over the day. Had the onion flatbread as an appetizer and was impressed.  Jalapeno shrimp & grits was exceptional as well as the BLT with fried soft shell crab. After eating - luckily after eating - watched bartender open large jar of olives and pick out with bare hands to skewer as condiment for martini's.  Three olives per skewer - she must have done 100 of them with her bare hands while handling cash, credit cards and register and then back to touching the olives. Amazing service.  They have their own micro brewery which is cool.  Oysters fresh and great!  Overall food was good with good presentation. Ok.  Just ok. I had high hopes but fell flat.  Service was excellent, setting is nice and location is convenient if you are staying in a hotel downtown.  The menu was small as I expect for a better restaurant.  However, the fried oyster salad and hamburger just didn't hit the spot.    Oyster salad had six fried oysters that were cooked ok but the batter didn't have much flavor.  The hamburger had large smoked bacon that was mostly fat and chewy.  Had an ok taste but for $17 I expected more flavor.  The fries were excellent!!   I would give it try if I was ever in the area but can't say I would make a special trip to visit  again or go out of my way to avoid if I was in a group that wanted to visit Luke's. This was very disappointing to us. We really wanted to have a nice quiet evening so we could talk and enjoy each others company. However what we got was a very noisy restaurant with people yelling and screaming (most likely drunks) and the restaurant was extremely crowded. We felt like we were sitting on top of the tables next to us and could hear EVERYTHING they were talking about. We were greeted at our table but  2 (two) servers who said they would both be taking care of us. it took them twice as long to take our drink orders, serve our drinks and to finally serve our food. The food was the best part, we really enjoyed our dishes as they were cooked perfectly. We really wanted to like this place but the overall atmosphere really killed it for us. Came here for their Happy Hour.   Oysters on the half shell- half of them were clean, half still had pieces of shell and sand Fried Oysters- smaller than we expected, but better than the raw oysters Pate- very rich and mousse like Dined here on a Friday night at 5:00.  Not busy but our waitress was extremely inattentive.  My husband's Cabernet was served in a juice glass filled to the brim, but about 2\" wide.  Definitely set the tone for what continued to be a disappointing meal.  My skate wing could have been good if it were not greasy and soaked in sauce.  Husband gives a \"2\" a great disappointment. Have been to Besh's August many times, as a couple, foursome and large groups. Never less than xlnt. At Luke we were seated promptly. Wine service: had to practically beg for the white which was tables away. Was still on appetizer when server tried to place the main dish on the table. Couldn't be dissuaded so all on table at same time. My fish dish xlnt, partner's (same dish) mealy and inedible, ?old, refrozen?? Gumbo highly recommended by waitress had enuf seafood, but was bland, not New Orleans style. Hope this was an off night Did not complain as we did not want to offend the other couple. We had Luke's for dinner and i must say i was not impressed with a lot of factors.   The items we tried were:  Baked pesto oysters: People said this was amazing, but i thought this was alright. I'd rather have the char-boiled oysters or fresh oysters.  Gumbo: This was alright as well. Nothing stood out about it to me.  Ribeye steak: Pretty good flavor to the steak, however, not as tender as the other places.   Overall, I thought this place was pretty mediocre. They forgot our dinner and other tables who came in later got their dinner first, so we had to remind them. They also forgot my bread that came with the steak. It just seemed like an off day for them. Customer service was good, but not fantastic. Yah, definitely stick to the oyster for happy hour only. The other stuff is not a good deal. Went here and sat at the bar to dine alone. Food was good, wine pour was way short and service was terrible. The bartender was extremely rude from the moment I sat down. I am in the hospitality industry so I try to be extra nice to those in the service business. Well, this girl didn't want to have anything to do with me. She seemed annoyed that I even sat there to begin with. I had to ask twice for my wine and where I sat (only seat available at bar) was sticky so I asked for it to be wiped down. She never smiled and couldn't get rid of me fast enough. There are many other restaurants that have great food so I will not come back here or recommend to anyone else. This place is meaty! Not much for a vegetarian. The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The express menu seems like a great deal. A soup, entree and desert for around $22, I believe.   It's loud but comfortable with a fun atmosphere. I had much higher hopes for a Besh restaurant. I went for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty crowded and very noisy. The best part of my meal was my cocktail. The experience only went downhill from there. The waiter was slow and not very attentive. Tables that ordered ten min. after got their food five minuets before me. My sandwich was poorly cooked. Too hard on the outside and too soft on the inside. My boyfriend disliked his meal too. I think the restaurant tries to to mix too many food types. German and Cajun and French and Southern.... just not good enough for a Besh More than a 2 hour wait for our meal. Mediocre and overpriced, but good service. Service was very slow, over 3 hours for dinner. I had the ribeye, cooked med rare, asked for med. steak was this and grizzly with no seasoning. Potatoes were cold,crawfish bisque was a way to salty. The menus didn't have a selection that looked exciting food to me. They seem to put an ingredient on everything to make it different, just not appetizing to me Don't walk in to this place without a reservation. 7:18 on a Monday night, open tables, open barstools - asked about dinner for two.  Was told no way until at least 9. Not offered seat at bar - just \"no\". Good luck. Looked decent, guess we'll never know.  Nope, not giving them a second chance. I don't understand the big deal.  Told 45 minute wait on a weekday at 4. My friend made a reservation thru Yelp after we walked in and that got us seated in 20 minutes. None of us liked the half price specialty drinks. The Brussels sprouts were tasty as were the fried oysters, but honestly we had better at cheaper restaurants. We had the lamb dish and the shrimp and grits which were both served piping hot. Our server was pleasnt but very busy! The service was terrible. The waiter brought our food and never came back to check in us. The oysters were terrible. They were not shucked to order. We told the waiter and he said that happens when it's busy. We told the manager who apologized and took them off our bill. I will never eat there again! Just checked in at Luke's, apparently they can't combine two 2 seater  tables for a Grp of three because the restaurant closes at 11 and last call for food is 10:30....  Food is important and so, is the customer and when it's almost restaurant closing time, you can always do a lil more coz the crowd flowing in is less... Went here on a friend's suggestion for happy hour. Went for the happy hour oysters. The oysters were 75 cents each. They just tasted okay. I wouldn't come back again because I'd rather pay more for better tasting oysters. Also got the brussel sprouts. Those were really good but after a while the sauce they have on them started to taste too sweet.  Didn't get to try any of the other food. I have been to Luke many times for breakfast and thought it was so great.  Took my sisters out tonight for dinner and it was an embarrassment!  Service was not good.  No review of the menu, no offering of specials. My ribeye was 80% fat and cold, as were my potatoes.  Im not happy and wont return.    If you eat there, go for breakfast.  Dinner was terrible. My food was good, loved the texture and flavor. The Lüke Salad was a bit too salty. My partner's food was a bit on the blend side, the bratwurst was huge but not very flavorful. The Service was great, the atmosphere was awesome also. The interior feels like it's part of an old, classic, and fancy hotel. It's small but cozy. The service is nice. There are revolving doors at the entrance but they don't work.  This restaurant focuses solely on food although breakfast is in the category. They don't have anything else beyond coffee and tea, which was fine.   I ordered the fried chicken biscuit. It was the most expensive $14 biscuit I ever bought. The fried chicken was entirely tasteless. Maybe that's what the honey was for. However, the meal came with a pile of grits that had a subtle salty taste and grainy texture I enjoyed. The biscuits were baked well. Everything but the chicken was great. This is my third time at Luke. Not a great experience this time due to careless service. He didn't write down my orders. We had to ask for services from other random servers.   Crawfish bisque  Matzo Ball & Roast Chicken Soup (not my fav) Blue Crab  1/2 Dozen of Louisiana Shrimp cocktail Fried oyster salad (not my fav) Chicken tender and French Fried Apple juice( didn't make it for this table) Pâté of Louisiana Rabbit & Chicken Livers (didn't make to the table) We came here for happy hour. The raw oyster is smaller than ACME. There is no non alcoholic menu and the coke is 3.75 and NO REFILLABLE. Very disappointed and will not recommended to anyone. Luke was a pleasant enough place, but not nearly as nice as it believes itself to be.  We visited for lunch on a Saturday, and the food was fine. My steak was a perfect medium, which was odd because I ordered it medium rare. The music was so loud that the waiter misheard us several times. A restaurant pretentious enough to have half of its menu in French should probably have more  discernment than to blast 80s pop at a volume that barely allows for conversation.  The tables were small and crowded, the food overpriced, and the wait staff unskilled. In a city filled with excellent food choices, I definitely will be looking elsewhere for a pleasant meal. With rock star status,  New Orleans Chef John Besh serves up amatuer garage band grub at Luke.  Is he peddling some sort of  Alsatian - Creole - Black Forest - Bistro grub?  Who knows; I don't get it.  On a recent visit to Luke, my red fish was served coated with a soggy batter and covered with a tasteless dollop of lump crab meat.  The desert of bread pudding was swimming in an overwhelming praline sauce, making this New Orleans staple virtually unrecognizable.  The waitstaff look silly in white tunics.  Is this place REALLY a John Besh restaurant?  Having previously dined at August (another Besh venture), I find Luke to be terribly disappointing ... completely incongruent with Besh's reputation.  NOLA has much better to offer within easy walking distance (away) from Luke. One and done! Rushed and spotty service in a cramped space with pedestrian room temperature food! Not sure who has been giving the good reviews Greet food but the service is terrible. .we cant eat pork and we ordered the shrimp and grits after the waiter assured to us that they can do it without. Guess what..other waiter brought the order and said without pork but it has. We returned it and after few minutes they brought us one as ordered. Normal restaurants send a manger to apologize or get the order off the check or at least provide something complimentary. ..this place did nothing of that... Wanted to try the happy hour on the recommendation of friends/locals. The service was somewhat cold and unfriendly. The Happy Hour oysters are a great price but they quite large - not everyone's favorite. Jumbo shrimp were really rubbery and hard to get out of the shell. Sour cocktail, excellent; fries, good; vegetable sides, okay. We didn't particularly like the atmosphere or the service, so we'll be investigating other oyster happy hours. The happy hour special of 50 cent oysters, which is daily, 3-6PM, is awesome, and that is the best thing about this place.  Oysters were fresh, great flavor, and you can't beat the price.    However, the other food we tried there was only OK.  The fries had good flavor, but were super soft which is not my preference for fries.  The Salad Luke was overly dressed so the dressing overpowered any other flavors in the salad.  We also tried the gumbo, which was good, but not fantastic.    I would totally go back for the happy hour and so I will likely try other items on their menu, but I think their oysters is really the only reason to come to this restaurant. Located within Hilton Hotel, I made a reservation via opentable app. They were busy and people were having a great time. They were a bit too loud after too few many drinks.  I asked for a quite table I saw in the back but they didn't want one person to sit there.  Server was friendly and fairly prompt.  I tried gumbo and oysters for a small dinner. Gumbo wasn't what I remembered as a traditional gumbo. I am not a gumbo expert but it wasn't what I remembered from 10 years ago.  I arrived after a happy hour but I heard they have a good happy hour menu here. Nothing special , average classic American concept food . It is not a restaurant gives you good after delish memorable   taste . You can experience this restaurant for one time and nothing special about it I went to Luke with fairly high expectations.  The food was actually very good, but, the atmosphere was far from what I was expecting.  I had heard Luke had a nice Charcuterie dish and it was fantastic.  However, the atmosphere made my wife and I feel like we were eating at a diner .  There were plenty of people at the restaurant, and again, the food was outstanding, it was just all in the presentation of the feel of the restaurant.  I would give the food a 5 star, but, the restaurant only a 3 overall due to the atmosphere of the place.  If you are looking for high end food with a very casual atmosphere, this is the place! Disclaimer: This review is solely based upon a few cocktails, oysters on the half shell, and pomme frites.    I enjoyed Luke's happy hour. As my dining companion put it, \"Luke is the John Besh restaurant for the working class.\" Nestled nicely in the dining dearth of the CBD, seer sucker clad businessmen and women are of great attendance here. Oysters are 50 cents, cocktails (originally priced under 10) are half off between the hours of 3-6 pm.   The champagne au peche, St. Charles Streetcar cocktails were tasty, but not as stiff as I would have preferred. The oysters were fresh but lacked anything to accompany them (such as crackers). We asked for bread and solved this problem. The pomme frites rank third on my pomme frites Nola list.    Overall, very enjoyable. We were seated immediately with a reservation. The food was good, but there are lots of places for good seafood in New Orleans. Despite having two servers I felt like there were long periods of waiting to order, waiting for our drinks, waiting for the plates to be cleared. For the price, I just wanted more. Overpriced touristy fare served up on crisp white table cloth. The waiters are either imbeciles or criminally indifferent; they have the competence and sophistication of C minus middle-school students suffering from chronic ADD. I guess that's what they mean by living in NOLA: working at Luke is the Big Easy. Leave Luke to the wide-eyed travelers from East Cleveland and go to Mother's across the street. Order yourself the Charlie Stevens Bloody Mary. After a visit to Luke, you'll need it. My business partner and I had lunch at Luke yesterday and it was terrible. We ordered the tuna and Brussels Sprouts appetizers to start off with. The Brussel Sprouts were hard and under cooked and the tuna was nothing special. My friend ordered the soft shell crab sandwich for his meal and I had the burger. His soft shell crabs were greasy and so were the fries that came with it. My burger was over cooked, the cheese was burnt and it was barely edible. We were in a hurry so sending everything back and complaining to get new food wasn't an option. All I know is this will be the last time I go here for any meal. Fish was overcooked. Service was pretty bad too. I told them of a food allergy, but the food came out with said ingredient on the plate. They agreed to remake the food. By the time my food actually came out, everyone had to leave to get back to a work event (and we were there for 1.5 hours, so it's not like they didn't have enough time!). The servers and managers came over and apologized profusely, but they did not offer any compensation: e.g. dessert, drinks, a free meal. Talk is cheap. Luke is not cheap... and not cheap enough to warrant this kind of service and food. Hmmm. Went here during happy hour with my fiancée. We made reservations (I highly recommend this or you'll be standing forever hoping by some miracle you'll get a coveted spot at the bar). So all was well. We were seated, ordered drinks and a dozen oysters (75 cents, baby!) And half-priced beer and wine? Awesome! We then ordered the flammenkuchen. My god, so good. So much bacon. Do this! But then!!! Things took a dramatic nosedive when we ordered another round of drinks and oysters. Boom, the 5-star service/experience disappeared. Our waiter basically abandoned us, and we waited no less than 45 minutes before we finally got our second round. They did apologize, but come on. Not sure what happened, but know this place can be, very quickly, hit and miss. Still, those oysters were amaaaaazing. We went here because the reviews were all excellent. While the service was good the food was just ok. Not impressed. If your normal is macaroni grill you will like it. If you are a foodie you will be disappointed Not my favorite Besh experience. My gulf fish was fine, but my boyfriend's burger was bizarre. I'm not sure if it is intended to be eaten open face, but that is how it was served. It seemed like an odd way to serve such a large burger. Service was a little slow, but given how busy the restaurant was, not unexpected or unusual. The waitress was a bit...off. She openly flirted with my boyfriend, which made for an awkward dining experience considering my parents were present (maybe she thought we were siblings, but event then, still very odd behavior). Overall, my food was fine, and service was average; though, I'll stick to Besh's other restaurants. I have eaten at the Luke in San Antonio, which was top notch. So when a friend wanted to go during our recent trip to NOLA, I didn't hesitate. I wish I did.  Every single one of our dishes were extremely salty. One of us had the burger and the other had the shrimp and grits. We couldn't finish our food after a few bites because it was so salty. And sadly, we both got sick for a few hours after leaving Luke's.   I was hoping for the same performance I received at the San Antonio location but was greatly disappointed. I will never visit the NOLA location when I visit the city again. The NOLA location could learn a lot from the Texas location. Oysters are fresh and only $0.75 each during happy hour, but shell chips left on oysters and ruin the texture. Grill oysters are good at taste but too oily. Fried oysters are over cooked and too salty. One star for the price and fresh oyster, another star for the service and environment. Just went for a late dinner. Our appetizer was never put in and when we inquired about it, it showed up with our meal. Disappointed in the dinner visit. Interested in trying out breakfast/brunch. Nice enough restaurant. Excellent service and ambience, but I wasn't floored by the food. I went in with the expectation for real Cajun, New Orleans food so that might of been what messed me up. If your after authenticity, try something else. But if you just want a nice meal in a nice place, give it try. I felt like I wasted my time to come here I am not interested in raw oysters. I was under the impression they had other oysters they sold in singles by themselves. Quite a walk from French Quarter to come here. The selection of the cocktails is very very very minimal I was confused why that is.  This is more of a place to go if you're staying at a hotel nearby and don't want to go out of your way. The entrées looked good but they're very small and pricey I came for happy hour I was disappointed they didn't have a bigger selection. I am disappointed with my experience at Luke. Reviews tallying 4 stars suggested a good experience, but i must not have ordered the right thing- the organic quinoa bowl. The bowl is cold- quinoa and roasted vegetables. The poached egg was warm and perfect, but the salad came smothered in a horseradish dressing. It may not have been that bad, but horseradish was never mentioned in the menu, so it was a surprise and WAY too overwhelming. The cheese was tasteless and the many many cherry tomatoes were mostly over- ripe and squishy.  I won't return since there are so many great restaurants in NOLA. Not my favorite place.  It's waaay expensive for simple foods.   It's like Zea's except that they charge double!  My friends love the oysters and oyster prices, but I'm just not an oyster person. I went for Happy Hour oysters over French Quarter fest weekend and definitely got my money's worth from the food. Four dozen oysters, a sandwich and drinks between two of us came out to be around $60.   We called ahead and were assured that we had to get there early or they couldn't accommodate us, which might have been because it was FQF weekend, but the place was empty upon our arrival and had plenty of seats available when we left.  Being rushed in early and the attitude that accompanied that cost them a star in my review when added to the \"lukewarm\" service (sorry, couldn't resist).    I'd go back again when I can spare the time (shucking oysters takes a while) and when they can offer to accommodate me at an hour that doesn't make me feel like I'm too late for lunch and too early for dinner. It was a busy Monday night. Service was spotty. Our fries were cold and limp, the steak underdone. Drinks and oysters were good though. If you like salty food, get the shrimp and grits. Service was awful! Food was probably good but because the waiter served it cold we were unimpressed. Unfortunately the fella that served our table was training a new waiter so don't expect the service to improve. We had to ask who our waiter was after 15 minutes with no service. We weren't offered bread that other tables had. SIL asked for his beer to be served with his meal and it didn't come until he has finished his meal.  On the positive side the crab bisque was nice and hot and delicious. Was very excited to try Luke but was disappointed. Was with a group with a set menu with choices which all sounded great. Gumbo which was described as one of the city's best was average at best. Duck w/ crispy rice had all the right flavors but duck was medium well w/o any crispy skin. The bread pudding was all pecans and little bread to contrast. Service was good. Maybe individual dining would be better but in a city that lives for groups you have to get this right. I had high expectations based on reviews for this place. The service (in my opinion) was NOT good although we were assigned 2 different people (Kevin and Chi). Every time we had a question or needed something we had to flag them down. Odd, it was a Tuesday and not overly crowded. The crab bisque was amazing. However, they served a cup when we asked for a bowl. Quickly rectified this though and served us a bowl. The baked oysters were good, the pasta I absolutely would do without. I wouldn't revisit, it's not worth the money to deal with LESS THAN GREAT service and okay food. Food was just okay. We had the schnitzel and it was tough and overlooked. Service was slow, didn't get our first drinks until after the appetizer was served. Overall felt rushed. Came here for dinner and had very unfriendly service. Two people at our table's food was cold when served to us, so we asked for them to take it back and heat it up...They only took one person's ignoring the second person. When they returned the second person asked again for them to heat up their food.   The tablecloths had paper on top, which was not classy at all and reminded me of a cheap family restaurant.   Was not impressed with our visit. This was very mediocre in my opinion! The service was just okay, the courses were way too spread out, and the food was very okay. For what we spent, I can think of a hundred other restaurants I would have rather gone to. Restaurant linked to the Hilton on St. Charles. Limited menu item selection. Excellent soups & salads.   Happy Hour 3-6 with reasonable drink selection.  Lunch until 4. Very pricey afterwards. Excellent bar service.  Very good table service.  If female dining solo you may get missed by waiter numerous times while they seem to prefer guests dining with a male & missed for follow ups after receiving your meal, no matter how pleasant you are. As a solo diner suggest you dine at the bar so you can get served quicker Came here for breakfast and I was very disappointed. I got the chicken as waffles and the chicken was so dry and the waffles were just ehh. I wanted to love this place because I heard so many great things! But I can't even finish it cause It was just okay. The taste of everything was good, just everything felt so dry.  The best thing I had there was probably the french fries. Maybe next time I come back, I'll have a better expereince. Sorry, Lüke - this place just did not meet expectations.  It's a white tablecloth kind of place, with waiters dressed in crisp shirts and black vests and ties. The items on the menu are a little pricey, so I decided to go with the Tabasco and honey fried chicken biscuit, a smaller dish, with a side of grits.  Though the biscuit and chicken were good, I wasn't wowed. The food was lukewarm, which made the grits kind of hard to swallow.   Don't get me wrong - I think it's good food, but compared to everything else in the area, it's just not /as/ good. It's a beautiful place with very good services, and it's cross street from our hotel (intercontinental). I picked it to have brunch based on the good reviews and it's so close. It took about 15 minutes to sit at our table with reservation. I saw people just couldn't wait any longer and just left. So if you decide to try it, MAKE RESERVATION.  As for the food, it's okay. I had the shrimp grits (a little salty for my taste) and the rabbit/chicken liver. They are not bad, nothing special either.  I did enjoy the clean table cloth and attentive service for a change (since most of the restaurants in New Orleans are situated in old-dirty buildings with minimum service). When I was there, everyone around me ordered burger,fries,or po-boy. I would suggest you go else where for more authentic local cuicine. Tried to walk in without a reservation and told to try the bar (which was full) and not offered a wait time. Considering we were dressed appropriately (dress for the lady, collared shirt for the gentleman), this felt unwelcoming. We went across the street to Trenasse and had an amazing dinner with no wait. Had my first mint julep here and I discovered  that I am not a fan. It was too sweet & strong for me. I tried the mussels and fries dish which came with a ton of mussels. They didn't skimp on quantity at all. Since I was visiting from Denver, a landlocked seafood less state, I was ready for any quantity of seafood. I also tried the croque madame (no egg = croque Monsieur) which was ginormous & presented on a cutting board. I tried the seafood gumbo which was really expensive but tasty. The potion could have been larger. Interior of this place is really nice with subway tiles and classic wood panels. The servers wear white coats & were very helpful and attentive. The majority of the patrons were business people. This place is walking distance from the French quarters. Not what I expected.   Good food, great service but you have to have a reservation! No walking up to this place. Not the most amazing food, service or atmosphere- there are so many more amazing places to eat and experience. Was solid but just not worth the high price tag overall. I'm not a big one star type of guy, but in this case it's deserved. The level of chaos and poor manners from the hostess to waitstaff, servers to manager and even the servers to customers was so severe we left, after being seated and before ordering.  A server was loudly verbally trashing a patron to the manager, who obviously had no control, at the check in area, while the hostess rolled her eyes to us, clearly indicating this wasn't out of the ordinary.   These behaviors continued until after we had been seated. After getting up and beginning to walk out, one of the servers yelled \"What? How y'all going to leave?\" across the restaurant, confirming our decision to escape.  Hopefully, someone will read this and do some much needed hospitality training. The stuffed oysters were good. However our waiters were rude. I probably will not recommend to others due to the bad experience. Don't let them sit you in the back room which is SO loud.  Restrooms were clean, but smelled like sewage. There were no paper towels in the bathroom and one of the two soap dispensers was empty. Food was just not good. Simple gem salad was drenched in beet juice, it took forever to get our first round of drinks, two people in my party of 12 added crab to their salads and both thought the amount of crab was way too little for the price, two people sent back the shrimp cocktail because it was mushy and tasted funny, flat bread was good, gumbo was good, I won't be back. My experience mirrors that of Jon from MN. There are just too many outstanding restaurants in NOLA to waste a meal at a mediocre spot. In addition to the fair fare, our server was incredibly lame and he obviously had received zero training. We had to ask repeatedly for water, drinks, place settings and menus. When I asked who in the restaurant knew the wine list best I was initially encouraged when the bartender appeared. That changed quickly when I asked about a Cali red and he plugged it into his phone and proudly told me what town it came from. This was the full extent of his knowledge. Lastly, I tried to give management the opportunity to respond when I shared my email address on the bill in the section where they asked for comments. I wrote, Please email Me.That was three weeks ago. Zip. One and done. John Besh's restaurant is pretty good.  Its just unfortunate for Luke's that I had been eating way too many great meals in New Orleans and this gets lost in the shuffle.  For an appetizer we ate oysters and shrimp.  Both were really good but pretty standard appetizers in New Orleans.  For our main entree I had the jagershnitzel.  eh.  I wouldnt order it again.  The mix drinks werent as good as I had hoped.  Overall, I was really hoping for something better here.  Maybe it was the expectations.  This is really a 2 1/2 stars for me. Maybe the cooks that night were out partying at mardi gras. Very overrated  and It was underwhelming based on the great reviews. Service was good, but the food took a long time. We had the fried oyster salad and it was bland. The Brussels were ok, I think it was trying too hard with so many ingredients on it. The shrimp etoufee had nice flavor but wish it wasn't served as a pasta dish. Portions are quite large here. I'm giving Luke 2 stars.  The food was just ok.  But the service was not what I expected at all.  Coming to my home town and seeing for myself how the staff here is Chy St crazy to me.  We had to be moved because the air condition was dripping water on my back. So not cool. I hope when I come back it will be much better.... Chow for now Good food but service was bad. We had two servers - one was decent and the other not good - very casual attitude and didn't seem liked he had ever been trained. We were offered a dessert menu, accepted, but no menu ever came. Went with my gal pals for happy hour. It's a cool chill place. We enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the locals. Our server was great and very attentive. We stopped for libations and a lite snack but ended up getting coffee, dessert, and a cocktail. The cocktails were a bit strong for our taste but once the ice melted a bit they were good. Will definitely visit again before the end of our trip when we're not in a rush. Definitely over rated. Waited well over an hour for dry duck.  Tried NoLa a couple days ago and their duck was several orders of magnitude better. Maybe it was the day of the week we went (Monday) or maybe the time of day (12ish), but the place wasn't anything special, just blah.  The waiters could smile a little more, but service was okay.  I got the croque madame, hubby got some ham? roast beef? sandwich, and wanted to get our little one mac & cheese - but they were out of cheddar???!...so a basic grilled cheese was out too...Is this a serious restaurant?  The ham was a bit salty so overwhelmed both our meals, and I'm not so sure the bread was fresh.  First impressions count, so won't be coming here again. I see why they call it Luke's..... everything was LUKE WARM. Waste of money and time. Food tasted like it was cooked 2 days ago. I could of made a better breakfast with 1 arm tied behind my back. Cool looking place and good staff but the food was just okay. I went for lunch so I assume it was a smaller menu option. I got the burger and shared the brussel sprouts and both were presented well but like I said earlier it's was just okay. These guys make 1 good thing. A big honking burger with lots of meat and bacon. It's satisfying to say the least. They also have great parmesan fries here.   Other then that a very small menu. If you're looking for a burger in the land of creole, go here! I wanted to try this place after reading reviews and looking for some classy Louisiana fare.  I hadn't visited a John Besh restaurant before, and went with rather high expectations.  I started with the baked oysters, which were delicious.  For a main course, I ordered a steak, which was cooked right (medium) but was brought to the table at about room temperature.  My wife ordered a burger well done, it came out very red...however, they did correct that mistake with no hassle.  For the price, I'd expect better. Amazing oysters , during HH it is only .75 each.   I also ordered crawfish bisque, basically no crawfish.. my bf ordered shrimp jumbo, portion is really small... Everything tasted ok, but since I had a really high expectation to this place, it turned out to be just ordinary. I was a bit disappointed!  If someone said, pick one  word to you describe your experience here?  It would be INCONSISTENT.   I ordered the ribeye steak medium well, but it came out to me with portions of the steak well done to medium rare.  My son ordered the chicken tenders and one of the chicken tender was cold.  The raw oysters were delicious and fresh, but some had broken shell pieces in them.  The french fries were unforgettably heavily salted. Didn't expect this at all with the positive reviews I read. The positive is that my other son did enjoy his cheeseburger and my husband's shrimp and grits were really good!  So maybe it's just a different cook who dealt with theirs?  Who knows!  But if we ever do come back to NOLA, I don't think we'll be back here to eat again. OK, the food tastes great and the service is good.  However the portion and price of the chicken soup were completely ridiculous.  The bowl was only dampened with the soup at the bottom. We went to Luke for dinner. The room smelled subtly (and pleasantly) of sauerkraut when we walked in. The menu has German influences as well as local ingredients and dishes. We had the Wednesday special (Shrimp Creole) and the Moules  et Frites. Both were great. The mussels were some of the best I've had in a while - very fresh and flavorful.   Service was just OK - attentive, but we felt like we were being rushed, and our server seemed impatient. Used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Just went there and the waitress forgot to put my boudin order in. When I got it I didn't like it and wanted to order something else. I was told the kitchen was closed. I was seated at 10:15. Restaurant closes at 11. Got the Boudin at 11:10. I ate crackers and butter because I was hungry. Well, always a favorite so let's start there. The French 75 is always good and the oysters are always good. The food almost never disappoints. What did tonight was service. Fully staff, or don't open, or don't oversell when you don't have enough staff to cover. We love Luke, don't make us not want to come back. Currently under renovation. We arrived and their computers are down and won't be able to seat us for an hour...argh. and no other customers are waiting I tried this place twice prior to COVID. Management and hostesses were rude and unaccomodating. The oyster shuckers and bartenders were nice and friendly. I might give it another try soon to see if it has any redemptive value. Great HH from 3-6 where oysters are 50 cents and drinks are half off. The oysters were a bit sandy, but how can you complain at this price?  Service was a bit slow and our waiter said it was because the shucking station was backed up.  Understandable.  I also had a delicious red beet salad.  Upon arrival, I only saw a bunch of greens only to find layers of the tangy beet underneath.  It was topped with gorgonzola and spicy pecans.  Quite delicious!  Husband had the fried oyster bacon salad.   His advice:  Next time extra bacon and no oyster.  He didn't like the way they were fried.  The cube sized bacon bits were delicious tho!  I would definitely recommend this place for if you're in the mood for some oysters and a drink.    Make sure you try the homemade potato chips while you're there!! It was good, but for the amount of reviews and ratings I expected better. The Crawfish bisque is something I really recommend! The server put a $20 tip on my $45 meal, knowing that I was very upset with the service, and I put nothing on the gratitude line. Totally fraud!  I got the worst service ever, the server ignored me for most of time, my food was late for almost half an hour while sitting there out of the kitchen, even when I wanted to have the check I got nobody came to me. I complained twice but nothing changed, and I put nothing on gratitude when signing my copy, then later my credit card was charged an additional $20.  I wouldn't have noticed this if it was not for a business trip and I had to ask for a copy later to get it reimbursed. The soft shell crab \"BLT\" was good all around. The heaviness of the fried whole crab was nicely paired with fresh lettuce and tomatoes on a light mayo bread. There was some sort of green sauce, but it didn't seem to add much to the dish.  The fries definitely could have been better. They reminded me of McDonald's fries after you leave them in the bag too long - soft and limp. 12/3/19 - updated review: I went back to Luke due to late work meetings. Well this time is wasn't as great. The service was great but the food was not. I ordered the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" which was amazing the the night before. This day, it was disappointing. The decor on the food wasn't the same. The dish came out cold. The waiter got it reheated but the food didn't come out the same. The grits were not as cheesy and delicious as the night before. It was watery and not as flavorful. The highlight was the brusselsprouts. They were flavorful and had a hint of spice to it. Simply delicious! I was very disappointed with the grits, the dish was the only reason I came back. The plating was even different. Don't waste your time, you can fine better food in the tourist area if the quarter.  Service and food not worth the time you have to wait for your food. wow super super super overpriced, this place has nothing special , also their product not even fresh order a blue crab dip, you'll see what i mean  absolutely this place not recommended  there's tons of places out side of downtown please look for them Came here for convenience-sake and it was a disappointment: 1) wait for food was longer than anticipated; 2) gumbo roux tasted like flour- no touch of Creole seasoning whatsoever- I did not finish it. In addition, it was lukewarm3) and kid's meal fries were limp from being saturated in grease.   I was not charged for the gumbo and I requested fresh french fries, which were delivered how they should have been initially. I will add I was given the opportunity to order another soup; but it was a tad late and I was over it.  The brussel sprouts were a winner.   Not sure what happened to the gumbo though (insert sad face). Even though the roux was thicker than what I'm accustomed to, it was bland. First night in NOLA to eat good food, and was disappointed.\n"

Nothing stood out. \\n\\nAfter eating the Shrimp and Grits at Cafe Amelia, we were excited to see how others compared. At Luke, you get a sizable portion and it's good but not great. \\n\\nOverall, there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere.\", \"Went there this morning for brunch. The waiter was not friendly at all. Had to keep asking for coffee refills...and creamer...and sugar. We were a party of 6 & all 6 of us were drinking coffee. How do you not bring more creamer & sugar? He seemed annoyed that i asked him to repeat the special. He never smiled or even looked at us. The portions were large. Overpriced. I had the burger. It was nothing great. Bisque was good. My son had the crabmeat omlette which he didn't like. My other son had the croquet madam which he liked. We will most likely not go back.\", \"We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.\\n\\nThe cocktails, however, were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again, I unfortunately can't comment on the oysters.\", \"The only reason they get two stars is that when we mentioned the 2 entrees we ordered were barely lukewarm, they took them off the bill.  Otherwise it would be one star.\\n\\nWe went with another couple, ordered wine and appetizers, which were alright but unremarkable.  All of the staff seemed frazzled and disorganized, stuff kept being dropped all over the place.  After we were served the entrees the waitress didn't check back until we called for the bill.\\n\\nThat's when the other couple and my not-shy wife complained, and the manager came over and apologized and did the right thing.\\n\\nWe ate at another Besh restaurant nearby, Domenica, the night before, and it was outstanding.  Go there instead.\", \"My fiancé and I ate breakfast here and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  I had the beignets which were overly sweet and the filling didn't quite work. The fiance had the southern breakfast, said the eggs were cooked poorly and the grits were too salty.  Overall it wasn't terrible, but it was probably the most disappointing meal we had during our four day trip to New Orleans.  We did eat here on a Monday morning so it may have been an off day.\", 'While this is technically a German\\'ish restaurant, it has a lot of options and really seems more rustic French to me.  It\\'s a good choice for a \"nice\" lunch downtown.  The daily specials are usually good.  All of the sandwiches I\\'ve tried are great with Croque-monsieur being my favorite.  The brunch is good too but if I\\'m downtown for brunch I want to go somewhere with live jazz.', \"Hostess staff less than cordial (girl with the 'Sideshow Bob' hair acts like she really doesn't give a Debbie Wasserman Schultz about her job); wait staff mediocre and tried to charge us for something not ordered that a manager gave us to make up for poor performance; foo foo food with a fancy cook's name; waste of expensive space\", \"Food was decent. I ordered the chicken with potatoes. The potatoes tasted weird and had like a weird tangy flavor. Chicken was dry and salty. Waiter was charming but bad with filling up water. He would fill one cup up and leave the others empty for no reason. Also had a very small selection. Though, I tried my brothers hamburger and it was outstanding! Children may not like this place but it'll be fine for adults unless you're picky.\", 'Simply did not stand up to rating. Very mundane at best. They did offer to substitute some veggies for the less than satisfying potatoes served with roasted chicken.', 'My expectations were quite high as the place was listed in the \" must visit\" in NOLA.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night. The atmosphere was nice enough. The wait staff friendly but so-so. We were a party of 4. We ordered cocktail, the appetizers. The appetizers came out before the cocktails, which I thought was odd. I ordered the same drink, several times. Each time it came, it looked different from the last. They have a dish on the menu with Marcona almonds. They almonds were not Marcona almonds. Ok, yeah, big deal. But the point is, the menu says one thing, they deliver another.  Not what top tier joints do. Shrimp and grits was very good. Other meals were ok, not stellar.  I think NOLA has many better choices. Limited selection in bar.', \"Was really pumped to try this place Bc John Beche has such a good reputation but it was totally mediocre.  I'm from NYC so have access to excellent food and maybe that's why I found everything to be lacking but generally there wasn't anything j couldn't cook at home myself. Don't bother.\", 'Food is not worth the price, fills a hole at best. Went there for brunch because of the reviews. Menu had some leftover food on it from last customers. Service was ok, coffee was way too strong and had floating grounds in it. Probably one of our least favourite meals while staying in New Orleans.', \"I was in town for business and too tired to venture out and find something. Since I was staying at the Hilton next door, I decided to go out of convenience. I thought I would keep it simple with a burger and a beer. I'm always a sucker for a good burger!  I'll say that the burger meat itself was cooked to perfection (medium) with some great smokey flavor. However, the accompaniments were not so impressive. The bacon was limp, there was very little cheese, the bun was dry and crumbly, and the fries were barely warm and limp. If they had taken the time to prepare everything properly, it could have been amazing. For an $18 burger, I expect there to be a little more attention to detail.\", 'This place is part of the Hilton hotel and way more expensive than the Yelp price range suggests.  Room-service food at room-service prices!', 'A typical refined oyster bar with friendly staff & well portioned dishes. The service however regarding pacing of dishes is off & needs refinement as main courses were brought while we we still working on our appetizers & then we were expected to make room. Overall though a good place to perhaps meet friends.', \"If you like practicing your lip reading skills (noisy) and daydreaming about who on earth trained the wait staff (who can't manage simple things like a water refill when they bring your food and your glass is dry; who can't bother to serve an a la mode dessert with less than completely melted ice cream; who don't warn you that one of the desserts is drastically different from the description on the menu), this is your place.  The mediocrity of the food won't distract you much from that core experience, though the bill might.\", \"Luke does the room service for the Hilton. I wouldn't recommend ordering room service. It was below average and I found the gumbo to be very bitter.\", 'Out of lager and serving Jagerschnitzel that was way too salty and covered in salad dressing. This is German food? Nein Danke. Portions are appropriate for a German stomach.', 'Went to Luke for happy hour expecting to come away with a smile on my face and a belly full of delicious $0.75 oysters.  Little did I know that retribution would be inflicted upon my bowels for my gluttony and stinginess.  Food poisoning from these oysters ruined my entire Mardi Gras weekend, leaving me starving and sober during one of the most hedonistic festivals in existence.

The restaurant ambiance is Ok and the service is good', 'Had breakfast here today. Service is very unattentive and we had to call the waiter multiple times for coffee refil and he also overcharged our check.

It's also priced as if it were a nicer restaurant.\\n\\nI just ordered soup since I wasn't all that hungry to begin with, and it was just ok. My friend, however, ordered a full entree for $26 and she said it was subpar at best. The fries were soft and the schnitzel didn't have much flavor. It was a $30 fried meal basically. The staff also seemed inexperienced. They were nice though. \\n\\nI know we didn't have to order what we ordered. Maybe if we had ordered something else, our experience would have been better, but overall we weren't impressed.\", \"Worst service I have EVER received, we had alarge party and they were rude from the start!  Ride about our orders, rolling eyes and huffing.  Bearded, shirt skinny server was worse in my life!  Made everyone uncomfortable!  Mentioned to another host?

The service is very friendly & very fast. The best part of our meal was the chocolate pecan tart for dessert.\\n\\nThe food was okay. Not fabulous. And when we ordered we specifically requested our food not come immediately after our starters.. It did. Maybe we were too full to enjoy them, I don't know. But I feel strongly that when a request like that is made... It's not difficult to honor. I was disappointed. We had the Mahi & Wild Boar Ragout, again, average food. The kale with the Mahi was DELISH though.\", \"Are u kidding me? Not only were there 8 tables open when we walked in and they told us a 3 hour wait...

We all wanted the chaMpagne au peche - $9.75 - champagne & fresh peach, but the restaurant ran out of peach.\\n\\nAfter our meal, we had to walk back through the nasty fish smell, which then turned my stomach.\\n\\nFor a John Besh Restaurant I was VERY disappointed.', 'The food was just not good enough to match the price.  Very expensive and the food did not particularly wow me.  It was overall OK.', \"This place didn't have anything German on the menu.  The burger was good but not $16 good.  Kind of overpriced for what they had.   It was okay but it is not worth the prices.\", \"Didn't live up to expectations.\\n\\nWe were excited based on all the positive reviews, but Luke sadly didn't pay off.  I started off with a mint julep which tasted like bourbon water. Zero mint or sweetness to it.  For dinner I had the shrimp and grits which was very tasty, but the portion was so small.  It was sized more for an appetizer rather than entree.  When I pay over $20 for a dish it needs to be somewhat filling.

We gave them the benefit of the doubt, and assumed they were reserved. We took a seat at the bar, where we were helped by an amazing bartender who also seemed confused that we weren't able to get a seat.

I also try a kind of big sandwich with smoke ham, that was just good, and shrimps and grits, so-so. I really liked the decoration of the place, but the service wasn't that good. We needed to wait for a while for our meal. Overall, kind of disappointed.\", \"Eh. Tasty food but careless, amateur service. I've honestly never seen a wait staff not give a shit about service as I saw at my meal at Luke. Randomly distributing plates as they came our of the kitchen with no apparent thought to having apps out before entrees.  Literally they stacked the tiny table full of appetizers and entrees all at once with no acknowledgement seemingly that fine dining establishments don't do that.

I visited this place under the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, and I ended up enjoying myself.  The shrimp \"en cocotte\" was well- cooked (with the most perfect McEwan and Sons grits of course).  The husband\\'s jagerschnitzel was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste to it (I noticed ham bits - is that tasso?).  His meal included a soup and a dessert, which was a steal for $23.  The seafood gumbo tasted alright though the rice tasted old and dry. The profiteroles were a nice touch even when we were all stuffed by the end of the meal.  \\n\\nEuropean with a Cajun flair - not too shabby a place.

Third, I had the bizarre mozzarella-topped ham and cheese sandwich, and my homegirl had jãgerschnitzel, both of which are kind of hard to mess up--we both could only bring ourselves to eat half of our portions with great willfulness.

Great flavor, but the texture of the shrimp is a big turn off.\", \"The food was excellent but unfortunately the service made the night less than memorable. We ordered an appetizer plus a seafood platter with crab legs and a bottle of wine. We had to refill our wine twice (which isn't easy while cracking claws) and my utensils (claw cracker, little fork, shell plate) were taken before I was finished. The service was overall aloof and rushed. Had it not been for the unwelcoming service we would have stayed for dessert and cocktails (i.e. more business for the restaurant).

Not one of the three hostesses greeted us.  The service was slow, took fifteen minutes for our wine decanter to arrive, although our waitress was something close to nice.  The food arrived fast, but it was AWFUL.  I almost cried.  The Friday special, the court bouillon, had a synthetic taste to it.

Why not? Well, we had a seafood tower (the medium sized) and the crab was over cooked (really???). A few of the mussels seemed over cooked to me as well but I might be nit-picking.

All of this was good but HEAVY.  I felt sort of dizzy after. That might also have something to do with the fact that this was one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to in my life.

The worst offender was the Bibb lettuce salad (not sure how they messed up a salad, but they did) and the overly salty french fries. And the matzoh ball soup was just awful - but then again, why did I order that at a french brasserie? Probably because it was 30 degrees underneath the A/C (which they claimed they couldn't turn down because it's controlled by the hotel they are in).\", 'Breakfast this morning -- mediocre.

Being rushed in early and the attitude that accompanied that cost them a star in my review when added to the \"lukewarm\" service (sorry, couldn\\'t resist). \\n\\n I\\'d go back again when I can spare the time (shucking oysters takes a while) and when they can offer to accommodate me at an hour that doesn\\'t make me feel like I\\'m too late for lunch and too early for dinner.', 'It was a busy Monday night. Service was spotty. Our fries were cold and limp, the steak underdone. Drinks and oysters were good though. If you like salty food, get the shrimp and grits.', \"Service was awful! Food was probably good but because the waiter served it cold we were unimpressed. Unfortunately the fella that served our table was training a new waiter so don't expect the service to improve. We had to ask who our waiter was after 15 minutes with no service. We weren't offered bread that other tables had. SIL asked for his beer to be served with his meal and it didn't come until he has finished his meal. \\nOn the positive side the crab bisque was nice and hot and delicious.\", \"I had high expectations based on reviews for this place. The service (in my opinion) was NOT good although we were assigned 2 different people (Kevin and Chi). Every time we had a question or needed something we had to flag them down. Odd, it was a Tuesday and not overly crowded. The crab bisque was amazing. However, they served a cup when we asked for a bowl. Quickly rectified this though and served us a bowl.\\nThe baked oysters were good, the pasta I absolutely would do without. I wouldn't revisit, it's not worth the money to deal with LESS THAN GREAT service and okay food.\", \"Food was just okay. We had the schnitzel and it was tough and overlooked. Service was slow, didn't get our first drinks until after the appetizer was served. Overall felt rushed.\", \"Came here for dinner and had very unfriendly service. Two people at our table's food was cold when served to us, so we asked for them to take it back and heat it up...They only took one person's ignoring the second person. When they returned the second person asked again for them to heat up their food. \\n\\nThe tablecloths had paper on top, which was not classy at all and reminded me of a cheap family restaurant. \\n\\nWas not impressed with our visit.\", 'This was very mediocre in my opinion! The service was just okay, the courses were way too spread out, and the food was very okay. For what we spent, I can think of a hundred other restaurants I would have rather gone to.', \"Sorry, Lüke - this place just did not meet expectations.\\n\\nIt's a white tablecloth kind of place, with waiters dressed in crisp shirts and black vests and ties. The items on the menu are a little pricey, so I decided to go with the Tabasco and honey fried chicken biscuit, a smaller dish, with a side of grits.\\n\\nThough the biscuit and chicken were good, I wasn't wowed. The food was lukewarm, which made the grits kind of hard to swallow. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong - I think it's good food, but compared to everything else in the area, it's just not /as/ good.\", 'Tried to walk in without a reservation and told to try the bar (which was full) and not offered a wait time. Considering we were dressed appropriately (dress for the lady, collared shirt for the gentleman), this felt unwelcoming. We went across the street to Trenasse and had an amazing dinner with no wait.', 'Not what I expected.   Good food, great service but you have to have a reservation! No walking up to this place.', 'Not the most amazing food, service or atmosphere- there are so many more amazing places to eat and experience. Was solid but just not worth the high price tag overall.', 'I\\'m not a big one star type of guy, but in this case it\\'s deserved. The level of chaos and poor manners from the hostess to waitstaff, servers to manager and even the servers to customers was so severe we left, after being seated and before ordering.\\n\\nA server was loudly verbally trashing a patron to the manager, who obviously had no control, at the check in area, while the hostess rolled her eyes to us, clearly indicating this wasn\\'t out of the ordinary. \\n\\nThese behaviors continued until after we had been seated. After getting up and beginning to walk out, one of the servers yelled \"What? How y\\'all going to leave?\" across the restaurant, confirming our decision to escape.\\n\\nHopefully, someone will read this and do some much needed hospitality training.', 'The stuffed oysters were good. However our waiters were rude. I probably will not recommend to others due to the bad experience.', \"Very overrated  and It was underwhelming based on the great reviews. Service was good, but the food took a long time. We had the fried oyster salad and it was bland. The Brussels were ok, I think it was trying too hard with so many ingredients on it. The shrimp etoufee had nice flavor but wish it wasn't served as a pasta dish. Portions are quite large here.\", \"I'm giving Luke 2 stars.  The food was just ok.  But the service was not what I expected at all.  Coming to my home town and seeing for myself how the staff here is Chy St crazy to me.  We had to be moved because the air condition was dripping water on my back. So not cool. I hope when I come back it will be much better.... Chow for now\", \"Good food but service was bad. We had two servers - one was decent and the other not good - very casual attitude and didn't seem liked he had ever been trained. We were offered a dessert menu, accepted, but no menu ever came.\", 'Definitely over rated. Waited well over an hour for dry duck.  Tried NoLa a couple days ago and their duck was several orders of magnitude better.', \"Maybe it was the day of the week we went (Monday) or maybe the time of day (12ish), but the place wasn't anything special, just blah.  The waiters could smile a little more, but service was okay.  I got the croque madame, hubby got some ham? roast beef? sandwich, and wanted to get our little one mac & cheese - but they were out of cheddar???!...so a basic grilled cheese was out too...Is this a serious restaurant?  The ham was a bit salty so overwhelmed both our meals, and I'm not so sure the bread was fresh.  First impressions count, so won't be coming here again.\", \"I see why they call it Luke's..... everything was LUKE WARM. Waste of money and time. Food tasted like it was cooked 2 days ago. I could of made a better breakfast with 1 arm tied behind my back.\", \"These guys make 1 good thing. A big honking burger with lots of meat and bacon. It's satisfying to say the least. They also have great parmesan fries here. \\n\\nOther then that a very small menu. If you're looking for a burger in the land of creole, go here!\", \"I wanted to try this place after reading reviews and looking for some classy Louisiana fare.  I hadn't visited a John Besh restaurant before, and went with rather high expectations.  I started with the baked oysters, which were delicious.  For a main course, I ordered a steak, which was cooked right (medium) but was brought to the table at about room temperature.  My wife ordered a burger well done, it came out very red...however, they did correct that mistake with no hassle.  For the price, I'd expect better.\", 'Amazing oysters , during HH it is only .75 each.  \\nI also ordered crawfish bisque, basically no crawfish.. my bf ordered shrimp jumbo, portion is really small... Everything tasted ok, but since I had a really high expectation to this place, it turned out to be just ordinary.', 'OK, the food tastes great and the service is good.  However the portion and price of the chicken soup were completely ridiculous.  The bowl was only dampened with the soup at the bottom.', \"We went to Luke for dinner. The room smelled subtly (and pleasantly) of sauerkraut when we walked in. The menu has German influences as well as local ingredients and dishes. We had the Wednesday special (Shrimp Creole) and the Moules  et Frites. Both were great. The mussels were some of the best I've had in a while - very fresh and flavorful. \\n\\nService was just OK - attentive, but we felt like we were being rushed, and our server seemed impatient.\", \"Used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Just went there and the waitress forgot to put my boudin order in. When I got it I didn't like it and wanted to order something else. I was told the kitchen was closed. I was seated at 10:15. Restaurant closes at 11. Got the Boudin at 11:10. I ate crackers and butter because I was hungry.\", \"Currently under renovation. We arrived and their computers are down and won't be able to seat us for an hour...argh. and no other customers are waiting\", 'I tried this place twice prior to COVID. Management and hostesses were rude and unaccomodating. The oyster shuckers and bartenders were nice and friendly. I might give it another try soon to see if it has any redemptive value.', 'It was good, but for the amount of reviews and ratings I expected better. The Crawfish bisque is something I really recommend!', \"The server put a $20 tip on my $45 meal, knowing that I was very upset with the service, and I put nothing on the gratitude line. Totally fraud! \\nI got the worst service ever, the server ignored me for most of time, my food was late for almost half an hour while sitting there out of the kitchen, even when I wanted to have the check I got nobody came to me. I complained twice but nothing changed, and I put nothing on gratitude when signing my copy, then later my credit card was charged an additional $20. \\nI wouldn't have noticed this if it was not for a business trip and I had to ask for a copy later to get it reimbursed.\", 'The soft shell crab \"BLT\" was good all around. The heaviness of the fried whole crab was nicely paired with fresh lettuce and tomatoes on a light mayo bread. There was some sort of green sauce, but it didn\\'t seem to add much to the dish.\\n\\nThe fries definitely could have been better. They reminded me of McDonald\\'s fries after you leave them in the bag too long - soft and limp.', \"Don't waste your time, you can fine better food in the tourist area if the quarter.  Service and food not worth the time you have to wait for your food.\", \"Came here for convenience-sake and it was a disappointment: 1) wait for food was longer than anticipated; 2) gumbo roux tasted like flour- no touch of Creole seasoning whatsoever- I did not finish it. In addition, it was lukewarm3) and kid's meal fries were limp from being saturated in grease. \\n\\nI was not charged for the gumbo and I requested fresh french fries, which were delivered how they should have been initially. I will add I was given the opportunity to order another soup; but it was a tad late and I was over it.\\n\\nThe brussel sprouts were a winner. \\n\\nNot sure what happened to the gumbo though (insert sad face). Even though the roux was thicker than what I'm accustomed to, it was bland. First night in NOLA to eat good food, and was disappointed.\"]\n"

       "'this place SUCKS. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food. This is my second time with the same results. I gave them the benefit of the doubt -perhaps having an off night the first time I went, but it was the exact same the second time around. Nothing innovative. They churn tables out and could care less that you are spending upwards of $150 for two. Save this one for the tourists. Decent, consistent food. If you\\'re in the CBD, they make solid food for a quick lunch or happy hour. This is only based on breakfast. The selection is limited. I was hoping they\\'d have beignets. In lieu of that, I got coffee, fruit, and bacon - sweet and salty. The coffee was great. The bacon and fruit were sad for $5 each. The bacon was scrawny. The few berries weren\\'t sweet, and the melons were under ripe. As with the hotel itself, the staff were rather muted - not especially helpful or friendly.  If it\\'s raining outside and you\\'re getting ready to leave, stay here for breakfast. Otherwise, go out. Completely UNDERWHELMED........ Love John Besh, but he wasn\\'t fooling me--that was étouffée sauce on the shrimp and grits!  If I wanted étouffée, I would have order it. Food was okay, but VERY expensive. We had New Year\\'s Eve dinner at Lüke. Two of our party of three ordered the 4-course set menu.  The waiter skipped the second course entirely, and then said it wasn\\'t a course at all when we pointed this out.  We sought clarification and the waiter was indeed wrong and did not understand the set menu.  Another waiter stepped in, offered to serve the second course after the third, and to give us complimentary champagne, more wine, money off our check, and extra food.    The solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the \"champagne\" was horrid, but it was New Year\\'s Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.    Overall, a bit of a disappointment. The menu is extremely limited and overpriced. Some of the seating is weird. I would not highly recommend this restaurant. John Besh. Brunch. You\\'d think you\\'d be in Creole heaven, but the experience was a bit dissatisfying.   I ordered the Friday express, which included a soup or salad and an entree. I forget what it\\'s called but it contained shrimp, oyster and a tiny crab claw. It was okay. Nothing stood out.   After eating the Shrimp and Grits at Cafe Amelia, we were excited to see how others compared. At Luke, you get a sizable portion and it\\'s good but not great.   Overall, there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere. Went there this morning for brunch. The waiter was not friendly at all. Had to keep asking for coffee refills...and creamer...and sugar. We were a party of 6 & all 6 of us were drinking coffee. How do you not bring more creamer & sugar? He seemed annoyed that i asked him to repeat the special. He never smiled or even looked at us. The portions were large. Overpriced. I had the burger. It was nothing great. Bisque was good. My son had the crabmeat omlette which he didn\\'t like. My other son had the croquet madam which he liked. We will most likely not go back. We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.  The cocktails, however, were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again, I unfortunately can\\'t comment on the oysters. The only reason they get two stars is that when we mentioned the 2 entrees we ordered were barely lukewarm, they took them off the bill.  Otherwise it would be one star.  We went with another couple, ordered wine and appetizers, which were alright but unremarkable.  All of the staff seemed frazzled and disorganized, stuff kept being dropped all over the place.  After we were served the entrees the waitress didn\\'t check back until we called for the bill.  That\\'s when the other couple and my not-shy wife complained, and the manager came over and apologized and did the right thing.  We ate at another Besh restaurant nearby, Domenica, the night before, and it was outstanding.  Go there instead. My fiancé and I ate breakfast here and it wasn\\'t bad, but it wasn\\'t great either.  I had the beignets which were overly sweet and the filling didn\\'t quite work. The fiance had the southern breakfast, said the eggs were cooked poorly and the grits were too salty.  Overall it wasn\\'t terrible, but it was probably the most disappointing meal we had during our four day trip to New Orleans.  We did eat here on a Monday morning so it may have been an off day. While this is technically a German\\'ish restaurant, it has a lot of options and really seems more rustic French to me.  It\\'s a good choice for a \"nice\" lunch downtown.  The daily specials are usually good.  All of the sandwiches I\\'ve tried are great with Croque-monsieur being my favorite.  The brunch is good too but if I\\'m downtown for brunch I want to go somewhere with live jazz. Hostess staff less than cordial (girl with the \\'Sideshow Bob\\' hair acts like she really doesn\\'t give a Debbie Wasserman Schultz about her job); wait staff mediocre and tried to charge us for something not ordered that a manager gave us to make up for poor performance; foo foo food with a fancy cook\\'s name; waste of expensive space Food was decent. I ordered the chicken with potatoes. The potatoes tasted weird and had like a weird tangy flavor. Chicken was dry and salty. Waiter was charming but bad with filling up water. He would fill one cup up and leave the others empty for no reason. Also had a very small selection. Though, I tried my brothers hamburger and it was outstanding! Children may not like this place but it\\'ll be fine for adults unless you\\'re picky. Simply did not stand up to rating. Very mundane at best. They did offer to substitute some veggies for the less than satisfying potatoes served with roasted chicken. My expectations were quite high as the place was listed in the \" must visit\" in NOLA.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night. The atmosphere was nice enough. The wait staff friendly but so-so. We were a party of 4. We ordered cocktail, the appetizers. The appetizers came out before the cocktails, which I thought was odd. I ordered the same drink, several times. Each time it came, it looked different from the last. They have a dish on the menu with Marcona almonds. They almonds were not Marcona almonds. Ok, yeah, big deal. But the point is, the menu says one thing, they deliver another.  Not what top tier joints do. Shrimp and grits was very good. Other meals were ok, not stellar.  I think NOLA has many better choices. Limited selection in bar. Was really pumped to try this place Bc John Beche has such a good reputation but it was totally mediocre.  I\\'m from NYC so have access to excellent food and maybe that\\'s why I found everything to be lacking but generally there wasn\\'t anything j couldn\\'t cook at home myself. Don\\'t bother. Food is not worth the price, fills a hole at best. Went there for brunch because of the reviews. Menu had some leftover food on it from last customers. Service was ok, coffee was way too strong and had floating grounds in it. Probably one of our least favourite meals while staying in New Orleans. I was in town for business and too tired to venture out and find something. Since I was staying at the Hilton next door, I decided to go out of convenience. I thought I would keep it simple with a burger and a beer. I\\'m always a sucker for a good burger!  I\\'ll say that the burger meat itself was cooked to perfection (medium) with some great smokey flavor. However, the accompaniments were not so impressive. The bacon was limp, there was very little cheese, the bun was dry and crumbly, and the fries were barely warm and limp. If they had taken the time to prepare everything properly, it could have been amazing. For an $18 burger, I expect there to be a little more attention to detail. This place is part of the Hilton hotel and way more expensive than the Yelp price range suggests.  Room-service food at room-service prices! A typical refined oyster bar with friendly staff & well portioned dishes. The service however regarding pacing of dishes is off & needs refinement as main courses were brought while we we still working on our appetizers & then we were expected to make room. Overall though a good place to perhaps meet friends. If you like practicing your lip reading skills (noisy) and daydreaming about who on earth trained the wait staff (who can\\'t manage simple things like a water refill when they bring your food and your glass is dry; who can\\'t bother to serve an a la mode dessert with less than completely melted ice cream; who don\\'t warn you that one of the desserts is drastically different from the description on the menu), this is your place.  The mediocrity of the food won\\'t distract you much from that core experience, though the bill might. Luke does the room service for the Hilton. I wouldn\\'t recommend ordering room service. It was below average and I found the gumbo to be very bitter. Out of lager and serving Jagerschnitzel that was way too salty and covered in salad dressing. This is German food? Nein Danke. Portions are appropriate for a German stomach. Went to Luke for happy hour expecting to come away with a smile on my face and a belly full of delicious $0.75 oysters.  Little did I know that retribution would be inflicted upon my bowels for my gluttony and stinginess.  Food poisoning from these oysters ruined my entire Mardi Gras weekend, leaving me starving and sober during one of the most hedonistic festivals in existence.  Perhaps management felt the need to cut costs along with increasing prices by switching to cheaper oysters.  Steer clear of this place until they reevaluate their suppliers. If you want great Oysters this place is a must-do. The restaurant ambiance is Ok and the service is good Had breakfast here today. Service is very unattentive and we had to call the waiter multiple times for coffee refil and he also overcharged our check. I had the duck omelete, which was greasy and the waiter also misplaced my toast side order for french fries. For a 30 dollar breakfast I expected much more, would not go back. This place looks a lot nicer than it actually is, unfortunately. It\\'s also priced as if it were a nicer restaurant.  I just ordered soup since I wasn\\'t all that hungry to begin with, and it was just ok. My friend, however, ordered a full entree for $26 and she said it was subpar at best. The fries were soft and the schnitzel didn\\'t have much flavor. It was a $30 fried meal basically. The staff also seemed inexperienced. They were nice though.   I know we didn\\'t have to order what we ordered. Maybe if we had ordered something else, our experience would have been better, but overall we weren\\'t impressed. Worst service I have EVER received, we had alarge party and they were rude from the start!  Ride about our orders, rolling eyes and huffing.  Bearded, shirt skinny server was worse in my life!  Made everyone uncomfortable!  Mentioned to another host? Who came by our table and she was rude too!  Food and drinks may be great at happy hour but not worth the terrible service!  Only place in NOLA that hasn\\'t been hospitable!   Server came back and apologized for his rudeness!  Shocking moves up from 1 to 3, still unhappy he ruined my experience.  Even though we appreciate the apology very much! Average touristy place. When acclaimed chef goes mainstream commercial, it brings below average plates / experience. I went here for breakfast this morning. Service was good. I would say the food is okay for what you get. I ordered the pancakes and a side of bacon. $19 later I was full but neither was out of this world. Maybe I\\'ll see if dinner is bettet Nice place. The service is very friendly & very fast. The best part of our meal was the chocolate pecan tart for dessert.  The food was okay. Not fabulous. And when we ordered we specifically requested our food not come immediately after our starters.. It did. Maybe we were too full to enjoy them, I don\\'t know. But I feel strongly that when a request like that is made... It\\'s not difficult to honor. I was disappointed. We had the Mahi & Wild Boar Ragout, again, average food. The kale with the Mahi was DELISH though. Are u kidding me? Not only were there 8 tables open when we walked in and they told us a 3 hour wait... We were about to order a drink at the bar when one of the waiters purposely kicked me in the back of the foot when I wasn\\'t looking and tried to play it off like one of their other hostesses did it.  Way many better other options in new orleans We went there after making a reservation for two. The menu does not have a lot of variety and the food is mediocre. I had high hopes but it did not meet my expectations. Service was good overall along with good ambiance. I don\\'t get all the good reviews!?? Everything was way over priced. Waiters snobby. Atmosphere....not casual. Everyone was dressy. The gumbo I got was meh. Shrimp and grits was ok. Nothing great though. Oh and the only refill we got was our water. Coke is in a bottle so I guess I should\\'ve expected no refills but on tea? Wasted $80. There are way better places to eat. Seafood restaurant, bill for $155 for 2, prices high, service really slow, food ok but nothing to write home about.  Our table wasn\\'t cleared for 20 m so we moved to bar, and manager checked in with to us.  Offered us a glass of wine, which is nice, but didn\\'t offer a discount.  Not sure I\\'d recommend.   Editing the review because the manager gave us a appetizer platter off of the bill.  Made us feel better. The food was pretty good but as soon as I walked into a restaurant it smelled like rotten fish. The smell was so bad we asked the hostess to seat us in the back.  I got the Southern Breakfast - $15 - which had two eggs, cane syrup sausage, biscuit and grits. We all wanted the chaMpagne au peche - $9.75 - champagne & fresh peach, but the restaurant ran out of peach.  After our meal, we had to walk back through the nasty fish smell, which then turned my stomach.  For a John Besh Restaurant I was VERY disappointed. The food was just not good enough to match the price.  Very expensive and the food did not particularly wow me.  It was overall OK. This place didn\\'t have anything German on the menu.  The burger was good but not $16 good.  Kind of overpriced for what they had.   It was okay but it is not worth the prices. Didn\\'t live up to expectations.  We were excited based on all the positive reviews, but Luke sadly didn\\'t pay off.  I started off with a mint julep which tasted like bourbon water. Zero mint or sweetness to it.  For dinner I had the shrimp and grits which was very tasty, but the portion was so small.  It was sized more for an appetizer rather than entree.  When I pay over $20 for a dish it needs to be somewhat filling.  Creme brulee for desert was good.  I would not go back. Waited over 20 minutes for our table even tough we had reservations.  Food wasn\\'t all that. I picked up the rib eye w side of carb meat. Had a beer at the bar while waiting for my food . Super nice bartender. However food is overpriced for the ok quality . 2 ounces of crab should not cost $13. Also when leaving I noticed fresh red drops of a liquid on the white floor , whatever that was . Loved it for Sunday brunch, dinner was hit or miss at our table.  Wasn\\'t impressed with the crawfish bisque, and some entrees can be pretty rich, a la the redfish court boullion.   The craft beers are great, oysters (at least the ones we had) were small and not very impressive. Don\\'t know if this is temporary considering the hit the oyster fishermen took, but we\\'ll see.  I\\'d say all in all it was a nice dinner, but no real show stoppers. At least on this visit. Made it to Luke\\'s for dinner and the crabmeat ravioli is AMAZING.  However I\\'m knocking off a star because the place was a zoo.    The next table was a 50th birthday party of 9 adults; one of the women was literally yelling at the top of her voice.  With tile/hardwood floors and tin ceilings, the volume in the restaurant almost ruined our meal.  It was exceedingly difficult to carry on a conversation at our table of 5 in between the shrieks next to us.    Other dishes at our table were the redfish (w/ the crabmeat), the vanilla duck, shrimp & grits, and the shrimp farci.  Everyone thought their food was lovely...if only the atmosphere had been as nice. I was really disappointed in the food here. The gumbo was so bland and the waiter agreed with me. The happy hour deal on oysters was worth it as they were a really good size. I wouldn\\'t spend my time going back here. The fried oysters were way too greasy! This place is pretty good for a couple of things, the Brussel sprouts and the cooked oysters. I\\'ve tried many other main courses that just didn\\'t wow me and took off stars for that. Service was good at least! My colleague and I ate here after attending a nurse practitioner conference. We had heard amazing reviews about this restaurant and were excited to experience a taste of New Orleans. We arrived at the restaurant and were informed it would be a two hour wait to be seated, though there were plenty of open tables. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, and assumed they were reserved. We took a seat at the bar, where we were helped by an amazing bartender who also seemed confused that we weren\\'t able to get a seat. After speaking with some coworkers, the hostess was able to get us seated in the mostly empty restaurant. Our waitress was rude and blamed us for moving a water flask we never touched. Food was decent. But overall a bad and strange experience. Positives:  We had the gumbo and fresh gulf fish--excellent.  The veggies were perfectly cooked (my wife still can\\'t stop talking about the brussel sprouts).  Negatives: The waitress was in a bad mood and my seat was right under the A/C vent.  I got so cold, I sat on the bench seat by my wife and another diner.  Food:  5 stars Service: 1 star Not happy with the changes to the menu. I miss the Choucroute Garnie and the escargots. I also loved having the option of ordering just the rillettes, but now you can only get the whole charcuterie plate. This was my second time visiting this place and while the food was good, I thought it wasn\\'t good enough to warrant coming back here yet again, especially since this is quite a pricey place. Came here for lunch. The service was good but the food was underwhelming, especially for the price.  Ordered the... 1/2 dozen stuffed PJ oyster ($19) Croque Madame with fries ($15)  The oysters were stuffed and broiled over a shrimp and crab mix. They were very salty and had very little flavor.  The Croque Madame is two pieces of bread with ham covered in cheese with an egg on top. This dish was also very salty with little flavor. The Croque Madame along with the fries was cold. The coffee and bentons bacon was good, but I wouldn\\'t order the frittata again, under cooked so runny in the middle, too much caramelized onion and the dressing on the arugula was pouring off the plate. Made for a soggy mess. Great deal for happy hour -- fifty cent raw oysters, one dollar fried oysters, 50% off drinks.  Unfortunately, other than the oysters and drinks we were a little disappointed. The Etoufee was moderately tasty but very small for the prince, the complementary bread was frankly inexcusably stale and un-appetizing and the foie gras terrine was on the edge of frozen when it came out.  Come for the happy hour drinks and oysters but skip the rest. We wanted to like the Flamenkuchen, but just didn\\'t.  Those big pieces of ham/bacon with all that fat was just too much.  And we encountered the most arrogant server, Kenneth, that we have ever had.  After the first course, we decided to cut our loss and not stay for anything else.  We expected so much more from a Besh restaurant. I\\'ve been twice for lunch and disappointed each time. The food is fine but in this city fine does not cut it. The service was down right bad the 2nd visit. Worst service! Told the hostess we wanted to sit in the bar area and she insists on sitting us in the back of the restaurant which is empty. Sat there for over 10mins with tons of staff walking by & just staring at us but no service, not even water. We finally got fed up and walked out. Horrible! We were on vacation and staying at the Hilton located within the same building.  The hotel recommended the restaurant for dinner after our arrival.  We found the staff to be unfriendly, cold and a little snobbish.  They had people walking in to seat and told \"us\" it would be a 2 hr wait, when we could clearly see seats available. at least 4 tables in the main dining and several in a back dining area.  We felt discriminated against because we were not dressed in a suit and tie or dress.  We didn\\'t wait! Luke is in the Hilton New Orleans.  It was late, raining, so stopped in for dinner.  I was impressed by the number of people that came in that weren\\'t staying at the hotel.  The service was good, food was okay - but not particularly special.  Breakfast was better than dinner. $5.75 for a Shiner or $8.5 for a Stella Artois... WHAT? That is not a good beginning in a restaurant when you see the menu. Finally, I order a coke, and the small one was $3 (no refill). About the food, I need to say that was one of the best gumbo I\\'ve never had. I also try a kind of big sandwich with smoke ham, that was just good, and shrimps and grits, so-so. I really liked the decoration of the place, but the service wasn\\'t that good. We needed to wait for a while for our meal. Overall, kind of disappointed. Eh. Tasty food but careless, amateur service. I\\'ve honestly never seen a wait staff not give a shit about service as I saw at my meal at Luke. Randomly distributing plates as they came our of the kitchen with no apparent thought to having apps out before entrees.  Literally they stacked the tiny table full of appetizers and entrees all at once with no acknowledgement seemingly that fine dining establishments don\\'t do that. Saved only by tasty food. Nice place. Food was decadent but pricey. Probably cause it\\'s connected to a high-end hotel. The crawfish bisque was delicious but super-rich. Kinda upset my stomach cause I\\'m not used to such fatty foods.   The service was decent albeit not terribly quick. They sat me in the very back of the restaurant even though it was fairly empty. I dunno why but found that odd. **3.5 stars**  Another John Besh restaurant with a European bistro flair, both in ambiance and food.  I visited this place under the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, and I ended up enjoying myself.  The shrimp \"en cocotte\" was well- cooked (with the most perfect McEwan and Sons grits of course).  The husband\\'s jagerschnitzel was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste to it (I noticed ham bits - is that tasso?).  His meal included a soup and a dessert, which was a steal for $23.  The seafood gumbo tasted alright though the rice tasted old and dry. The profiteroles were a nice touch even when we were all stuffed by the end of the meal.    European with a Cajun flair - not too shabby a place.  I\\'m glad I tried this place but there wasn\\'t anything that wowed me from this place. Go to Lüke and enjoy their .50 oysters and half-off drinks!    Having said that, the service at Lüke was less than sub-par.  Maybe the restaurant is understaffed or the staffs just don\\'t care enough, but we sat next to dirty table for at least 30 minutes.  What blew my mind was how the waiter who was responsible for attending the table went to get the tip left by the previous diners and left the dirty dishes sitting there. The Corn Crab Bisque was thin, everything in it was over-soft as if it had been sitting too hot too long. The Cochon pork was good, moist and tasty. The sausage was smoky but otherwise rubbery and forgettable. I had the bread pudding which came in a ramekin,  was at least 24 hours since it had been put together. It was nuked, the exterior was as hard as granite and the interior was cold. Yuck. Maybe I made a mistake ordering the special but I was mostly disappointed.  The service was good (it was a Tuesday night) and the bar served a good martini. Eek! Methinks not could not be more accurate! This place was not good!   The positive: they were able to seat us quickly and accommodate merging our two groups with two different reservations   The negative: the drinks were expensive, the food was salty (I sent mine back it was so bad, and I never do that and I am a salt lover!), some of it was cold and it was not worth the price we paid. Not to mention the rather slow service. The server tried to be really nice, but it often came off as weird (lots of laughing at his own jokes)   Find a better place to eat, you won\\'t be sorry! Luke was a go to for years. But my past two trips have been underwhelming. Appetizers forgotten, Oysters juices dumped in our guests purse by a waiter, shouting an cursing coming from the kitchen and less the courteous staff has removed Luke from my list. I always enjoyed the raw bar, mussels and fries when I did go. Brunch was fair.  Nothing was particularly offensive, but the overall quality didn\\'t feel consistent with John Besh.  FYI, I\\'d avoid the crab BLT.  Between the real brioche bread, mayo, thick-cut bacon, deep fried crab and french fries, sometimes too much of something is just too much. I dig the feel of this place--  old school new york subway station meets  fancy southern restaurant.  However, the meal didn\\'t live up to the setting.  The oysters were outstanding, but the prepared dishes felt short (meh on the salad and the shrimp). Also, the service was painfully slow. Came here for brunch on Saturday. Shrimp and Grits are the best thing here, definitely will come back for it. Stuffed French toast wasn\\'t really my thing, because it was dunked in whip cream and drowned with strawberry syrup. Really loud and busy place, set a reservation so you don\\'t have to wait. went for happy hour last week. the 75 cent raw oysters were great- just a shame that they came to our table after our entrees and after we had to ask what  happened to our order. sour disposition by the hostess and not very good service overall. Had the burger with fries, and the fries cooked in duck fat are as good as it gets though. Went to Lukes lastnight for a home cooked meal and this is not the place for that. No sweet tea, lemonade, sweet potato pie, jambalaya, or anything fried. Come here for an elegant, sit down dinner. The menu consisted of about 6 entrees, extremely limited. I had the shrimp and grits and they were just okay. We went at prime brunch time on a Friday and the place was pretty empty which should have tipped us off. The service was good but I wouldn\\'t make it a point to come back here. I have been to LUKE four times and this was my worst experience.  There was a hair in my Crawfish Bisque so I quietly brought it to the bartender\\'s attention.  She quickly removed the cup of soup and came back with a manager.  This is where I became disappointed.  The manager could not look me in my eyes and she never said, \"I\\'m sorry\" for the haor in my food.  She stated that it never should have happened (I agree) and she hopes I will eat there again.  She told me about the three new desserts and offered to give me a complimentary dessert or a new cup of soup.  Sometimes all you need to do is say, \"I\\'m sorry this happened.\"  I hope there\\'s some additional training on how to talk to customers and resolve issues in a professional manner in the future.  Otherwise, I love eating here! Wanted to eat here, tried to eat here, reservations are merely a stab at a time you may be seated and expect the curly haired blonde at the desk to treat you poorly.  We had a handicapped person in our party and even after asking for a chair for her 2x we were ignored.  No worries, thanks in part to the poor service we found The Pelican Club which we enjoyed immensely. Luke\\'s has been a go to in NoLa for the past ten years. It reminds me of a Parisian brasserie and is centrally located in the central business district. Our last visit to Luke\\'s was fair. The service was excellent as always but the food seemed rather uninspired. We had their house gumbo along with fresh and fried oysters, but the other menu items, I cannot even recall days later. Luke\\'s a place you can stop in for a burger and a beer - or oysters and a cocktail. The food\\'s solid and the atmosphere upscale. Disappointing.  Service mediocre.  Food okay.  Had the signature dish, highly recommended by waiter, of shrimp and grits.  Friend had the omelet.   Okay, but not fine dining by far.  Only time I have not rated a John Besh restaurant highly. Probably would give 3.5 stars, but settled on 3. Best part is the price of the oysters, you can\\'t beat 50 cent oysters during happy hour. Drinks were ok, but nothing special The ambiance of Luke is wonderful. The staff is on point as well. The food, well that\\'s a different story. For starters I had the matzo ball soup which was pretty bland and didn\\'t have nearly enough broth for the two matzoh that were provided. My main course, shrimp and grits was terrible. The shrimp were without a doubt frozen. The consistency of the grits were yet to be desired; very clumpy and lumpy. I have been to \"hole in the wall\" places with way tastier shrimp and grits. I\\'ll never be back again as both tables beside me were also very disappointed in their dining experience as well. Sorry Luke but you need to pick up the slack and revamp your menu. We had breakfast at Luke.  The restaurant opened at 7 am, but the staff was definitely not prepared for patrons from the Hilton next door.  We were promptly seated by the hostess, but we waited on coffee for 15 mins.  We placed our order and waited another 20 mins for yogurt/granola breakfast.  It wasn\\'t very busy with two waiters taking orders.  The bartender was refilling his bar but not helping the waiters either.   Food was okay, but I wouldn\\'t recommend this restaurant due to very poor service. This is an okay place to eat.  VERY noisy.  The food is only okay - it\\'s not special and is very forgettable.  It\\'s fine - it\\'s just not wonderful and memorable.  Service is okay.  It\\'s FREEZING cold along the edges of the wall.  There is nothing special about this place at all. I personally cannot recommend it. Second time I visited this restaurant,   Food:  5 stars.  I ordered the salmon dinner with sauteed local vegetables.  Superb.  Service:  1 star.  Overtly rude, slow, simply awful.  Yet, I\\'d go there again only because they are open late and we came from the airport. Hostess a tad rude, shrimp over cooked. Otherwise the bar tender was great!  Oysters are tasty My Boyfriend\\'s food was spicy to the point of being inedible. Mine was so bland it tasted like nothing.  Quite frankly after this and NOLA and I realized that I will not go to any more \"celebrity\" chef restaurants. Once they make a name they seem to stop trying, maybe the rest of us should stop going.   PS. The bread pudding was fantastic (as boyfriend points out). So we alter the recommendation and say go for dessert, skip the savory. Went for brunch on a Saturday. They offered us the \"breakfast\" menu-about 3 things on that menu. Ok-maybe 5, but certainly no more than 5. The couple that sat next to us 3 minutes after we ordered received an \"expanded\" brunch menu. Annoying. I ordered an omlet with crab, and my husband ordered eggs and meat. The coffee was delish-but they didn\\'t give us hot milk as with the first. The eggs were cold. I mean COLD. The fries that came with my omlet were well seasoned but COLD. Everything was cold. And the final bill for two breakfasts with coffee and nothing more-$48. Extremely disappointed. Food was so so.. Split some apps with coworkers, Brussels sprouts were good... We were not aware there were not free refills on fountain drinks and rang up a $20 bill on club soda, very annoying.  We were also freezing the whole time Staff was friendly enough but the food was just so over the top rich and $50 for breakfast for two at the bar with no alcohol was very expensive. We probably should have just went elsewhere after studying the menu because there really were no healthy options at all. Eggs, crab and a side of greens could certainty be a healthy meal but I think it was all rinsed in butter before it was served. Not for me, thank you. We were staying at the Hilton with a group of people. We decided to go down to the bar to have an appetizer and drinks prior to dinner. After hanging out for a couple hours spending around $700 for our group of 10-12 people, the manager approached us to tell us we needed to conduct business there or leave. What in the actual? In my town that\\'s real money. My husband was so pissed he wrote on the check, thank your manager for the tip. In 15 years, I have never seen him not leave a tip. She then had the gall to come berate us for not tipping. Btw, while our server was polite he was not very attentive. For the remainder of the trip, we walked directly across the street to the Intercontinental bar and had great food and service without anyone busting our chops. Lousiana rabbit terrine was dope.   Fried oyster salad w/ thick cut bacon - amazeballs.  Shrimp and grits - too much hype, disappointing. My shrimp was mealy...  Good but not great. Coffee was quite good. The French country decor was cool. however,  limited menu, sausage a little sweet, service a tad slow even when the place was not that busy. This is a Cajun restaurant, NOT a French restaurant!  The food is so so.  Happy hour drink is $5.  The restaurant is next to Hilton and very close to JW Marriott, Sorry. I was hoping this was going to be good. The food is just OK but worst of all is the service. The server and the hostess and another woman just stand at the front podium and giggling and don\\'t pay any attention to the customers. Zero attention to detail.  Um, I\\'m here paying your salary...and tip!  But I guess you don\\'t need the tip or the patronage.  Not recommended. Had a reservation on a Wednesday night for 9pm and the place closed at 11pm. Hostess was nice enough, but once we were sat no one greeted us, or acknowledge we were even there. The tables were dirty and the seats were full of bread crumbs. We ended up leaving after 5 min and know one knew. Hope this was a once off deal. Gone downhill since my last visit. Customers dressed like they were at McDonald\\'s. Waiter had no knowledge of wines (could not even pronounce them) and took no effort or time to explain the menu. Servers, whose uniforms didn\\'t fit, seemed bored and unhappy as they slid plates across tables, truckstop style, again taking no time to explain what dish was being served. My wife\\'s pasta was cold. My fish was tasteless and dry lying over uncooked, inedible vegetables. Waiter appeared annoyed when we were honest about the quality of the food. Manager said he would \"take care of it,\" which usually means some sort of comp, but not here. Poor service, we were seated and waited for at least 15 minutes before even being acknowledged. When someone came to the table they assumed we already ordered drinks - we informed the server he was the first person we had come to our table. Our waiter finally arrived and was unhelpful when asked questions about the menu. Very lackluster all together, wish it was all that we were told it would be....:( Went for brunch today. Had eggs in purgatory. Mediocre. Eggs over cooked. Service was ok. Not impressed. No high standards. Commercially average. Suggestion to check dishes before they leave the kitchen. Great oyster half shells.   Went there for lunch had the Thursday special lunch.  Jambalaya was ok just a bit too much of pork for my taste Ordered a dozen oyster half shells and waited for awhile  It turned out my server forgot to order and left.  The server who had us after my first server left was quite nice.  We had to order a half dozen cause we had to head out to the airport.  Food were nice and the oysters were great.   Wanted to try more but couldn\\'t.  By far the worst service i have experienced in New Orleans.  I was disappointed But i will give it a try again next time i come.   Hopefully, i will have better experience Gotta say this last time as a bust.. We come to NOLA once a year and have eaten here each visit. This time though nothing worked. The food was cold, the wait staff was not attentive and the overall experience poor. We were greeted by a ho-hum hostess and a waiter in a dirty jacket who stuck his elbow in my wife\\'s face as he poured my coffee.  Don\\'t get the eggs in a jar as they have goopy texture problem. Dry tough sausage and watery chocolate for the beignets provided the finishing touches to a perfect breakfast!  Couldn\\'t get out of there fast enough. Service was fine but the food was a great disappointment. Ordered the shrimp etoufee but it was really pasta etoufe. 5 small shrimp and a lot of pasta. I\\'d expect this in New Mexico but not New Orleans. Manager said that\\'s the order but didn\\'t charge me. I didn\\'t want no charge, I just wanted a good meal While the food was excellent the service and prices left something to be desired for me.  I was seated underneath a particularly cold air conditioning vent and when I asked them to turn down the air I was told \"that\\'s just the way it is\".  The food was a little on the expensive side for what it was, but i\\'d still recommend this spot if you\\'re in the area. I\\'ve been to the one is San Antonio and I thought I would give this one in New Orleans a try.  Needless to say, in both places they ruined my order.  I\\'m never going to another Luke\\'s!  Food was ok. Service sucks! Food is good, waiter not!.  Their wines by the glass are overpriced! So I ordered a Sauvignon blanc for $12... Bill arrives and was charged $14. I asked the waiter if he would double check for me. He brings me a menu with the $12 printed as I had seen and proceeded to tell me that it was a misprint and that the wine was indeed $14! Wow, that took some nerve, really? So, I deducted two bucks from his tip. Very disappointing. The waiter seemed rushed. He didn\\'t answer my questions about what i ordered correctly, so i ended up not getting what i was expecting. Our lattes were luke warm. No pun intended. As well as the food. It came out very quickly and my friends croque monseiur was not even melted in the middle. I got baked or fried kale when i was expecting wilted. The server asked my friend (as she was putting food in her mouth) if she was all done eating and did she need a box?!?!?!?? Not what i expected from JB. Think ill steer clear of celebrity chefs from now on... Had two very well behaved kids with us and they said they wouldn\\'t have a seat for 1 hr when it was evident there was plenty of seating available. They could have just told us kids aren\\'t welcome. Hostess even fumbled around with the lie Ehhh... At least for lunch. Étouffée was ok if you live in Wyoming. Value and cost are not commensurate... Not even close. Go to a diff John  Besh (like Borgne near the Hyatt Regency)... The cocktails were fantastic. I\\'d have drank many more French 75\\'s if only I could have. The food was good, but it didn\\'t knock my socks off. I\\'d come again for lunch, but it probably wouldn\\'t be my first choice. I would come again for drinks any time. First place we walked into upon arriving to the city...right outside our hotel. Greeting ladies seemed flustered that we did not have reservations at 3:30 on a Thursday???  Anyway, although there seemed to be plenty of available tables...they told us it would be a 1hr 45 min wait?!? Didn\\'t make sense...got the vibe if we would have dressed a little nicer we would have been treated differently, just my impression.   We were told we could go to the Bar...which was over crowded...seems the thing here is to send everyone to the bar while the tables sit empty??! Weird  Don\\'t even want to give them a second chance, too many other warm and friendly place close by! Went here for brunch and thought the food was just okay.  Had the shrimp and grits - $24 for five shrimp and an appetizer-sized portion of grits.  Food was a bit over-seasoned as well.  Left hungry and disappointed.  Maybe dinner is better?  Service was subpar for the type of place this is - it wasn\\'t particularly busy but waited about 5 minutes after finishing our food before the waiter came by to even  check if we wanted a coffee refill.  So much for southern hospitality... It\\'s okay.  Kind of cold and not very welcoming. Loud!  no soft surfaces to absorb noise. The burger that everyone loves was really nothing special. Hey, I\\'m allergic to onions (yeah, that stinks) so they bring me a burger without the grilled onions BUT IT WAS ON AN ONION ROLL!!! Maybe they were trying to kill me.... anyway, I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to eat at Luke. no matter how they spell it. The wait for a larger group on Sunday night was ~a half hour. Service was super meh. The waitress interrupted our conversation so many times for unnecessary reasons and it felt so intrusive. We were also rushed so much to finish quickly (even though the entire wait for a table was because two tables had paid already and weren\\'t being rushed to leave...). Even though I asked for the remainder of my food to be boxed, it ended up being thrown away, which I found to be a strange miscommunication...  However, the food was not bad. I didn\\'t like the Brussels sprouts (14$) -- too salty and overcooked, and they were billed as crispy, which they weren\\'t really. I did like my entree, the fried oyster salad (17$) a lot. The oysters were crispy and tasty, and the greens were quite good. I got the shrimp n grits and although it was very good, I could only eat one shrimp because of the gumbo and beignets I had an hour prior. I assumed since I had only eaten one bite and explained to the waiter it was delicious but I had eaten right before, he would box it up. As I sat there for long enough I realized he wasn\\'t going to bring it. The waiter apologized and said he\\'d make me another full order for the inconvenience. Unfortunately when I came home, I found that he had not given me a full order but only 3 shrimp (out of a total of 5 that come with a full meal). Very disappointing. The raw oysters were great! The creole gumbo was okay, my Bloody Mary was blah. It was a long ways away from the Bloody Mary I had this morning at Ruby Slipper.... which was amazing. Although Luke is conveniently located in my hotel, I think I may need to venture out for the remainder of my trip. Go here for the raw bar and only if you have the patience of a saint. The food here is mediocre. Over salted and over done. The bread pudding tastes like citrus, the rabbit sausage pasta has too much going on, everything is fatty and salty instead of flavorful. Service is awful. I once had a waiter spill soup all over me and they didnt even offer to reimburse me for my dry cleaning. John Besh needs to get his act together. Less time trying to be a celebrity and more time making sure his restaurants up to par. Jumbo shrimp and grits dish was amazing! Nice and spicy. The Gumbo was too bland for me even after adding loads of Tabasco to try and spice it up. The P&J oysters were creamy and delicious. I give it a 3 star because the service was subpar. Server literally came zero times after delivering our food to the table and it wasn\\'t even busy at all. 1st time....4 stars 2nd time....3 stars Last time....1 star!!!  I wouldn\\'t go back except for the happy hour oysters.  In fact, the oysters are the only consistently good thing on the menu....and you don\\'t even have to cook them.  It has been really salty the last two trips and it\\'s not worth the cost.  While not as expensive as New Orleans can get, overall not worth the trip. I don\\'t really have ANYTHING nice to say, so I\\'m tempted to say nothing at all... But in the spirit of helping others I will say that our service and food was poor... in fact my partner was served a salad with rotten lettuce pieces and a brown avocado. Upon sending it back because who\\'d eat that (especially for what they are charging...) The waiter snatched the plate off the table and didn\\'t say a word. I realize he didn\\'t make the salad and technically he\\'s not responsible for it but his reaction was a little unreal... My $21 crab app was meh... so we didn\\'t even bother to order mains and left. I\\'m so confused by all of the reviews raving about this place. In a word? OVERRATED. Great late night place ,you get lost in it.  Food service this quality just expect a little bit more . Limited menu which changes. Be sure to check in advance if you want a specific dish.  Great escargot  Limited pours on drinks I\\'m a big John Besh fan.  But I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this restaurant.  Our seats were in a very busy spot with lots of passing traffic. If we had known we would have asked for the back room. The table was too small to hold all of our food.  Drinks took too long to come.  We had the brussel sprouts. ...they were very interesting and tasty.  Other than that, the food was okay.  I guess I had my expectations too high. The place has an impressive menu but I was not impressed by the atmosphere. I felt like I was in a church hall at a pancake dinner. Not much ambiance. The rabbit pasta was OK. I probably just ordered the wrong thing because everyone else loved it. Luke was a good experience. I went on a weekend for brunch and really enjoyed the food. Everything was reasonably portioned but it was a little on the expensive side. I don\\'t mind paying for food in any capacity but I spent $70 for two on brunch and that turned me off a little it. But even with the price being that high for brunch, the food was still great. I tried gumbo for the first time here. It was OK, there shrimp was too squishy, something else in it tasted funny. The base of the gumbo was OK tho, maybe it was old idk but never had i had shrimp just squish in my mouth.  The service was terrible, the guy never came. I had to flag him down for a refill (which took 10 mins).  Food came out fast but i wouldn\\'t recommend I just wasn\\'t impressed. With so many wonderful places to eat in NOLA, I expected something really fantastic and just was completely under-whelmed. After I posted my review of Luke, I was contacted by their general manager who apologized profusely and let me know specifically how they were making changes to the hot room, services as well as the food.  He also invited me to come back to set things right.  Very impressive and I look forward to giving Luke another try.  Well done! Food was good.  Hostess was extremely rude though. Hostess\\' behavior seemed to be racially motivated as we were the only Asians in the restaurant.  I don\\'t know if the food quality is worth the rude behavior by the staff.  I will avoid this restaurant in the future. I\\'m on the fence with Luke based on very poor service yet very good food.    We were greeted by a not so warm hostess and told we would be seated on time based on our reservation. Unfortunately, shortly after a group of 7 came in and were ushered ahead of us because they knew someone working at the restaurant.  Perfectly fine under most circumstances, but not when that ends up with us being seated a half hour after we were told.  Once seated, I was further disappointed that our server didn\\'t know much about the food she was serving.   Oh well... Once the food came all was forgotten and I was a happy camper once again.   We had a lot to eat, but the roasted beets salad  and cochon de lait sandwich were standout favorites. So they have fresh oysters, but you can get fresh oysters and a more welcoming attitude in so many other places in New Orleans. Why allow some bartender make you feel uncomfortable when you\\'re the spending money and trying to have a good time. I stopped here and had the Southern Breakfast. It was simple, yet delicious. Eggs perfectly cooked. I had the sausage and biscuit options which were great. But the star of the dish was the jalapeño grits. Not spicy, just delicately flavored and added complexity. Service was slow and the bar smelled a bit fishy with fresh oysters being shucked. Nice and clean but oysters are ok... the fried oysters are better. Happy hour was ok... not worth for me imho I normally love Luke\\'s. but I came here w a group of first timers for happy hour. We ordered 100 oysters and they were dirty++, w broken shells, poorly shucked to the point where some oysters were just decimated. We had to send back 20 bc a few of us were sick of getting broken shells in our mouths. Service was good otherwise. Maybe the day we went we got the shucker on an off day. I was disappointed and my guests were too. We ordered the Sunday special Pork Grillades with gumbo and jalapeno cheese grits, and the Roast Chicken. Both were tasty, but the pork was very fatty (more than 50%) fat and the chicken was overcooked and needed to be cut off the bone and the butter knife wasn\\'t cutting it. Maybe it was just an off night for the great reviews.   It was also a little pricey for a $$ rating on yelp. Meh. I\\'ve been to other Besh restaurants and have enjoyed the experience way way more. BOTH times that I\\'ve been to this place, I expected so much more than I got. I insisted on taking my fiance here after his NOFD Academy graduation, and to say I was embarrassed for not choosing a better spot is really an understatement. Not only was the menu minimal, it wasn\\'t nearly what I was hoping for to celebrate such an occasion. If you\\'re in the area and spot this place, I would honestly only go in for fries and cocktails. My experience was disappointing, but that could very well be because I ordered the wrong dish. My friend and I both ordered the Tabasco and honey fried chicken with red beans and rice, the dish was very bland. We didn\\'t even eat half of our food. We also ordered the crab bisque and seafood gumbo, both were delicious.  The menu is pricey. Food was OK but very bad experience (the waitress dropped the source on me and my food). They did apologize but did nothing about my food. I tried to be nice though coz something like that happens. However, even I said nothing, what they responded was disappointing. Won\\'t come back:-( 4 stars for the food:  Loved the: raw oysters and escargot,  shrimp étouffée, grits shrimp, and gumbo. 2 stars for the ambience: Felt like a meat locker in there.  Waiter tells me it\\'s the hotel.  I literally had to get up and leave because it was so cold. I wanted to like this place more. It may have been a problem of my expectations. I thought that Luke was Cajun but a lot of the dishes were French.  I enjoyed the beet salad a lot more than my shrimp and grits. They were ok. The shrimp and grits at Dante\\'s Kitchen are way better. My friend did not like her fish dish. After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed.  The service was a little off. It seemed like our waiter was trying to upsell us and the prices were steep for what you actually got. Attempted to go here for dinner - checked open table to make sure there were open reservations. There were plenty (we weren\\'t sure how many would be in our party so I was reluctant to make a reservation before I had confirmed everyone). When we got there I was told a table for two was 2 hours. I checked open table again when we exited - I still could have made a reservation for virtually any time in the evening, there were plenty of empty tables as well. Not sure what the thought was here... Poor. Breakfast was terrible. Staff was not helpful and seemed inconvenienced by the business. I heard good things about this place but I was verry disappointed.  Yogurt and granola had an odor to it. Toast was burnt. Eggs were cold. Poor poor poor. I\\'m not sure if we went on an off night but our experience was memorable in a bad way.   The waitstaff wasn\\'t coordinated, drinks took forever, and our food was LÜKEwarm.   Out of the four of us, only one enjoyed the meal -- the ribeye. The other dishes were either bland or overflavored.   Additionally, we witnessed one of the waitstaff eating fries off one of our entrees, which left a horrible impression.   We walked out of the restaurant irritated because Lüke was the first restaurant we chose to try as soon as we got to NOLA. Not too good, not too bad. Service was slow but food was okay. Probably not worth the money though Was there for breakfast.  I had the healthy breakfast- yogurt with granola and berries.  It was ok.  Service was decent.  Not a place I\\'d go back, but I am glad I tried it once. I was very excited when I found a John mesh restaurant in my hotel. Than extremely disappointed with breakfast. The meal started with a miscommunication with our server and continued downhill from there. I ordered the egg white frittata which came out over cooked and tasting like it was fried in bacon grease. The side of potatoes were fried in bacon grease and contained bacon. As a vegetarian I was pretty dismayed the menu failed to mention this.   My husbands plate was lackng the accompania to advertised. The grits were dry and the requested butter to put on them took 15 minutes to arrive.   I would try this restaurant again but would choose lunch or dinner. Good food. Lovely staff. I had the crab omelet which was good but slightly over cooked egg. The accompanying waffle fries were delicious. This restaurant just wasn\\'t as fabulous as Restaurant August and Domenica, so perhaps my expectations were too high. Worst service of my life. Sat down at the bar and the bartender didn\\'t even wipe down the bar! We each had a drink and changed our dinner plans because we decided we didn\\'t want to sit with our elbows in crushed saltines and old basil. Wish I could comment  on the food, but like I said the bad service made us change out dinner plans. We love Lüke, but shocked they took the veal Jäger schnitzel, spaetzle and other items off their menu, so they are not really considered \"German\" anymore.  It\\'s a real shame too, since Lüke was the last restaurant in New Orleans that served it now that \"Jäger Haus\" (only other German Restaurant in the city) has closed. Had dinner here on my trip to NOLA. Food was tasty just a tad on the salty side for my taste. Fine dining prices with terrible service does not make a great meal. Our waiter took forever to greet us and seemed completely disinterested once he finally did. He got both of my parent\\'s orders wrong and they had thoroughly discussed their food allergies and sensitivities with him while ordering. The pacing of the meal was totally off; entrees were brought as appetizers and appetizers as entrees. Once it was set right, the food was all very good but the service left us all with a bad taste. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be returning. The interior is crowded and dim, but not in a cozy way.  We were seated at a table so close to the next patrons that we heard their entire conversation as if they were sitting with us.   The menu is limited and the service was so so (with the exception of the greeter who was genuinely friendly and attentive).   Regarding the food, the biscuits were bland; the fries were cold and the corn bisque was watery.  I ordered a Bloody Mary - although it was tasty, it was almost non-alcoholic.  For those it matters to, I think we were the only locals in the place. This place is coasting on a name. Our first impression was that the service was terrible. Food was mediocre and service continued to be terrible. Actually writing this review while waiting ten minutes with dirty plates in front of us, waiting to be cleared. Asked for the check as soon as we finally found someone to clear the table. Can\\'t wait to get out of here. So many better places to eat in NOLA! Thanks to the large, bald-headed man that looked like the manager... Lüke, you make me want to PUKE!! Service was so horrible, it left a bad taste in my mouth from our trip to New Orleans. They did not make any effort to accommodate our bachelorette party group without a reservation! This is an overpriced bistro with decent food. The restaurant lacks the kind of ambiance to justify their prices for food that is just OK. After reading rave reviews of Luke in our guide book and double checking on Yelp! we were excited to try it. Luke probably serves the most inspired German food in New Orleans, but it is still German food. Two stars seems generous. First, they don\\'t have control over their A/C and heat because they\\'re connected to a hotel, and it was FREEZING. Literally everyone in the place had their jackets on, and the food became lukewarm almost instantly. Second, the service was poor and uninformed--everyone there seemed peeved, and clueless about wine. Third, I had the bizarre mozzarella-topped ham and cheese sandwich, and my homegirl had jãgerschnitzel, both of which are kind of hard to mess up--we both could only bring ourselves to eat half of our portions with great willfulness. The ambiance is nice, but kind of chain-y, which could also be said of the food. It was a huge bummer to spend so much money on such sub-par food. A bit disappointing for brunch. They were understaffed and service was slow. Brunch menu is a bit limited. Had the fried chicken and biscuit which was solid. The egg on top was superfluous and forgettable. Shrimp and grits were just ok for the high price point.   Update: went back again for oysters at happy hour. Service was still pretty bad. The quality of the shucking was awful. There were gooey globs of dirt on the shells and on the oysters and most of the brine was gone. The food is great but the service is terrible.   Wife had shrimp grits (awesome but a little salty)  I had the rib eye and it was cooked to perfection. But I am still waiting for the dessert menu an I think I will be here until infinity. Jumbo shrimp does not have any flavor but being salty. Happy hour has cheap and good oysters. Should be able to use real butter instead of hydrogenated oil in their dishes boo !!!!! This is not a 2 $ place. Portion size was small and prices were large. Liked the food but would have liked more of it. Service was a little forgetful but friendly. Would not go back. This restaurant is the lobby of the Hilton where we were staying.  We tried three times to get in for a before dinner snack and twice for dessert each time the hostesses were less than friendly and told us that the wait would be over 30 minutes as we were staring at multiple empty tables.  The hotel staff advised us to order room service and that we wouldn\\'t be refused. So we decided to do that while we sat in the lobby and people watched.  The hotel staff had been wonderful the hostesses at Luke not so much. They are so rude. Service was good. But the food was incredibly salty. Beyond anything I\\'ve ever eaten. We ate at quite a few other Cajun/Creole places during our time in New Orleans. This was by far the worst due to the amount of salt used. Went there for a late desert. Cheese cake ... did not care for the after taste. Crumble... it was ok. Felt like my homemade was better. Seemed like a cool vibe great service just fell short on flavor Only 2 stars because everyone was nice other than that food was too salty and uncooked. I\\'m the type to not bother so I did not say anything, but, never again. Food very good  - waitress had a bit of an attitude and rather spoiled the experience - Shawn just acted like she wasn\\'t trying. Poor breakfast spot. We asked for an americano and latte and they brought drip coffee and drip coffee with milk. I\\'d prefer some honesty that they don\\'t have an espresso machine. Also no fresh orange juice. I basically have a crush on all John Besh restaurants and I LOVE that this place is open later than most!!  The beet salad is great!  I love the mix of blue cheese and pistachios.  It\\'s a perfect appetizer to go with the bread they bring out.  I went for the bacon cheeseburger, fancy I know.  This thing was huge and so good.  The fries that come with it are small and thin so if you\\'re into that you\\'ll be all over it.    I\\'ve been for brunch before a Saints game but since it was so crazy busy that day I can\\'t judge the service too bad.  Everyone is distracted on football Sunday!  The waffle was delicious no matter how long it look. Restaurant week menu had smaller portions, but overall very good. Wow, spent 200 bucks on food that had  NO FLAVOR. From crab legs to soup, boring and tasteless.  Hostess totally forgot about us. Not worth the $$$ or time This place was awful. Freezing cold, almost idiotic staff and really bad food. I mean BAD. My meat was tough, the spaetzle was dry and flavorless, the wine was no good, and my dining partners sandwich seemed as if it was a joke. It was huge, covered in cheese and almost inedible in size and flavor. I cannot begin to even fathom where these good reviews are coming from, or how they can justify these prices. I really would have rather eaten fast food than this crap. Came here for happy hour after the game. The person seating the customers looked completely overwhelmed. She sat people who were behind us first. Then lied to make excuses for not being able to keep track of everyone.  Would\\'ve like to try this place out, but the management has no idea how to seat customers :o In terms of the experience-to-price ratio, Luke\\'s breakfast asymptotically approached zero.  Our initial cup of coffee was, not ironically, lukewarm. It was eventually replaced, but only sporadically filled. (It bears mentioning that our server was managing exactly two tables.) The toast also was no better than room temperature - incidentally about 65 degrees - and it was replaced as well. The yogurt and granola featured no more than three tablespoons of insubstantial, powdery granola and perhaps half a cup of berries for $12. This stood in stark contrast to the previous evening\\'s uniformly outstanding experience at Emeril\\'s, at which no detail was overlooked.  The server predictably made no accommodation on our bill for either transgression, and so it was that we left $34 poorer, literally and metaphorically. Easy pick--shrimp and grits. It\\'s a southern staple and it is done really well here. You won\\'t hear this often...the butter is outrageously good. That\\'s right, the butter that comes with the mini baguette is actually memorable.   One knock...the gumbo. Specifically, the shrimp IN the gumbo. I suppose since it is made in huge vats and sits, the shrimp gets mealy, otherwise I would actually suspect that it\\'s *gasp* frozen. Great flavor, but the texture of the shrimp is a big turn off. The food was excellent but unfortunately the service made the night less than memorable. We ordered an appetizer plus a seafood platter with crab legs and a bottle of wine. We had to refill our wine twice (which isn\\'t easy while cracking claws) and my utensils (claw cracker, little fork, shell plate) were taken before I was finished. The service was overall aloof and rushed. Had it not been for the unwelcoming service we would have stayed for dessert and cocktails (i.e. more business for the restaurant). There were only a few tables that night. It is unfortunate that we will not recommend this restaurant to friends, despite the quality of the food. I joined YELP so I could write a review of this restaurant.  On day 3 of our trip June 15, I convinced my fiancé to go here because it\\'s a John Besh restaurant, and it was terrible.  We left feeling like we were just robbed.  Not one of the three hostesses greeted us.  The service was slow, took fifteen minutes for our wine decanter to arrive, although our waitress was something close to nice.  The food arrived fast, but it was AWFUL.  I almost cried.  The Friday special, the court bouillon, had a synthetic taste to it.  My fiancé\\'s roasted chicken was bland, but the mashed potatoes and crawfish bisque stood out in a sea of terrible.  The atmosphere is so lackluster - and on a FRIDAY NIGHT.  Never again. This place was a good happy hour experience because the cocktails were half off and the oysters were discounted. I had the French 75, which they make with cognac instead of gin; vastly preferable. I\\'m not sure I would eat here without the discount. Still, good place. Food was top notch - we had crab legs, beet salad and crespelle - all were spectacular. Unfortunately, the service was sub par. The courses were served on top of one another (half way into the salad, they delivered the main course) and shortly after, they were asking about dessert. We were clearly being rushed out. Expected much better from this type of establishment. Borderline offensive. Just so so, only is that location good, near to conference center and CBD, the food is definitely not $$, very little food for each entree, taste ok. Service, as we experienced today is not that good, wait a really long time for dishes. And no waitor add water. I came here with a few girlfriends for dinner and the service was a joke. Our server was rude for no reason... I mean, he set our water carafe on my breadplate. Wtf!? Weird. The only bad service we\\'ve experienced in New Orleans. This city is awesome. Excellent service, but the food was really really overrated. Was expecting much more. Everything was really fried and not overly refined. Service was very good though! Came here specifically for the Oysters during happy-hour and thought they were \"okay.\"  My group of girlfriends were so excited, we ended up ordering 2-dozen Oysters along with appetizers such as: crispy brussels sprouts, shrimp & grits, and house-made fries. The oysters weren\\'t shucked correctly and we had a few unfortunate surprises during our meal =(   Overall, it\\'s a good place to get your oyster fix while in NoLa but it definitely is not the best. Despite perfectly good food, the surly demeanor of the help from front to back can\\'t overcome the bad taste left in my mouth after eating at Luke. I took my son and his lady for Brunch recently and was thoroughly disappointed, especially after the stellar food, service and atmosphere at Borgne - where everyone seems genuinely happy to see you! Not sure why two places owned by the same group offer such wildly divergent experiences, but Luke is off my list for dining in the Big Easy. I wanted to like Luke more, but my two visits here have led me to only 3 very generous stars.   First visit here a year or so ago we were seated towards the back by a bust stand and stared at dirty dishes all night long.  This was so distracting I can\\'t even remember if what I ate tasted any good.  It must have been decent since I didn\\'t just leave mid meal.  I complained to the manager who had the dishes removed but within a minute there were dishes piled up on the stand again.   Second visit we had the seafood tower for two and it was a huge disappointment.  I\\'m tempted to try Luke again because of all the great reviews but not sure if I will. Ate at Lukes 4 times.  The first time it was great...the next three times it was barely edible.  Twice got one of the specials and was sadly disappointed.  The last time, I opted for the same dish I first enjoyed and it was not at all the same.  Hope his other restaurants are better. I love John Besh\\'s show. I was underwhelmed. After coming off of a cold watching the bartender slam paperless straws with her bare hands wasn\\'t fun. She also wiped at her nose a few times which made me no longer want to drink. The food was ok. Lauren, the other bartender was very professional and the cleanest looking employee there. I did buy one of the cookbooks Boyfriend and I took a mini vacation to New Orleans and wanted to try a local restaurant near our hotel. Based on reviews, we went to Luke to try it out.  ***Experience. It was A-OK.  We made a reservation and when we arrived, they said we can sit in the bar... Normally when I make a reservation, I expect at least a formal seating arrangement to have been ready or at least close to being ready. The service was decent. Nothing amazing but people just doing their jobs and serving you normally.  ***Ambiance: I expected it to be a little bit more on the fancy/intimate side but it\\'s not. The lighting didn\\'t make any romantic vibe but that\\'s okay.  *** Food: I ordered the steak/fries and my bf ordered a seafood pasta or something. They were both good savory meals. I found weeks Luke\\'s by checking out a gluten free restaurant option google search for New Orleans.  I\\'m so happy I decided to make reservations!  The food was incredible! The staff listened to my food restriction requests and delivered with tasty food.  Not just leaving off ingredients but making adjustments to the dish which enhances the flavors.  It was our favorite meal of the trip *(0 stars for the hostesses at the front, as I was met with rude stares and unfriendly demeanor upon looking for my party)  Group of about 12 of us, we came for some bites and HH oysters. We ordered a few dozen of these, some crab and corn chowder, and shrimp and grits. Everything was exquisite.... The oysters were FAT and the chowder was thick, the shrimp and grits were also to die for........ The food was nothing short of food-coma inducing.   The service, however, was super...... s l o w. Some orders came out late or perhaps even forgotten altogether. This combined with the surly hostesses at the front made the experience kind of meh. Food = 5/5 though. overpriced.  Had the swordfish and it was dry, possibly over cooked.  It was also about 6 ounces.  $28 for a 6 oz swordfish that wasn\\'t very good.  Disappointing.  Overall it\\'s a nice restaurant but it is overrated. I wish Yelp had half a star, because this should be 3.5 stars. I might be punishing this place just for not living up to my expectations, but I was underwhelmed. The brussel sprouts were the stand-out (so much so that we requested the recipe). But an appetizer should never be the most memorable part of a meal in my opinion. Honestly the brussel sprouts almost earned that 4th star from me, but I just can\\'t seem to make myself do it. Why not? Well, we had a seafood tower (the medium sized) and the crab was over cooked (really???). A few of the mussels seemed over cooked to me as well but I might be nit-picking. They should get those things right every time. In any event, maybe try the brussel sprouts and a salad. The waitstaff was overly attendant but very slow moving.  I thought it was just a southern quality but it was a bit over the top.  We were there for over 2 hours with a large group and a pretty empty restaurant.  If you want to take a slow leisurely brunch, then this is your spot!  But if not, I\\'d skip it because the food wasn\\'t extraordinary either.  Their jalapeno grits are enjoyable. Ate Xmas Lunch here. Downside: they ran out of shrimp. Upside: great crab omelette. Reasonably priced and lots of locals. To be fair: I didn\\'t actually get to dine here. But I still got low-rent service from a high-rent joint. And I wound up *way* happier down the street (see my review for Gallier).  Upon inquiring about a seat at the bar, the hostess said it was \"first come, first served,\" and that it\\'s usually a quick 15-30 min wait. After confirming it was okay to wait at the door, others trickled in 10-15 mins later also asking about the bar, and the hostess repeated the \"first come\" line. But she neglected to tell them I was the 1st person waiting for the bar--and didn\\'t seem to mind when the follow-up folks waiting stood over the shoulders of dining bar patrons, waiting to poach their seats.  After waiting a few more minutes to see how it\\'d play out (nothing changed), I left. And I don\\'t plan on coming back. The service was pretty bad. The food was ok but not exceptional. This place used to be very very good. I won\\'t be coming back with my friends when it\\'s time to pick a restaurant. 1. Surprised this is attached to a Hilton 2. Space is small 3. Food seemed salty 4. Wine list all Euro  Started w/ French 75 Cocktail. No mention of sugar on menu (cognac, lemon juice, champagne) but sweet.   Had the Salad with Oyster, split for two. Lots of Oysters for a split.   Shared Burger and Cassoulet. Burger was ok, did not like the small wooded cutting board as a serving plate. Awkward. Fries in Mint Julip cup were fine but salty.  Speaking of salt, Cassoulet was very, did not like the Garlic Sausage or the beans with Panko on top.   Server was nice. Prices decent. I\\'ll make it real simple, no fancy words or beautiful descriptions.  Basically if you want a good meal at a good price with good service this is NOT the place to go.  I repeat it is NOT the place to go.  Service was slow, in fact we almost got up and left until they finally sent the bartender over to take our order.  The food is overpriced.  I had the crab salad and it didn\\'t come with any salad.  Just a heap of crab meat, no flavor, and the bread that came with it was burned.  When I told the hostess, the bartender was standing next to her, and described how they put that particular bread on the grill and sometimes it comes out burned.  I couldn\\'t eat it.  It was black through and through.  nuf said. Unless I\\'m here for happy hour oysters (everyday between 3-6) the price doesn\\'t match what I\\'m eating. The happy hour oysters price went up recently from 50 cents each to 75 cents each. Maybe that\\'s to get rid of people who aren\\'t as fancy as the building suggests should be like me. Blind Pelican down the street offers much cheaper happy hour oysters now. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things but this place was not good at all.  We went here for dinner and I ordered the express menu which included soup, redfish court-bouillon and bread pudding.  For the soup, I ordered the gumbo but had to send it back because it was painfully salty.  Not just a little bit salty but it tasted like someone dumped in the whole shaker.  I sent that back and got the crawfish bisque which was not inedible.  The redfish court-bouillon was decent, nothing special and again seemed to be oversalted.  The bread pudding looked great but was just ok - probably the best part of a subpar meal.  Overall, very disappointing.  This place may be a great place to go for happy hour but for dinner it was not very good. You ruined my late valentines dinner with my wife. Not only was the service staff as unprofessional as could be, the kitchen staff completely dropped the ball. They could not cook a medium rare steak on the first or second attempt, then to have the balls to try and send me a free dessert to make up for the shortcoming was ridiculous. How about you just cook the steak right? Our server talking to us as if we were his friends and showing zero professionalism was another glaring issue, our table had a view into the kitchen and never once did I see the so called chef or any member of the kitchen taste anything they sent out. If this place is supposed to be a better option then the joints on Bourbon street, well the New Orleans you guys are fucked. Went there for Sunday brunch and was disappointed with food, menu and ambience. Oysters were good though. Will not return My husband and I had a 1pm lunch reservation. We were seated promptly. The server came over, after a short while, and asked about drinks. After a long while, he came and took our order. My husband had the Monday Expess...soup & fried chicken. He chose the crawfish bisque. ..it was outstanding. The chicken was served with red beans & rice. The red beans & rice, took the crispiness away from the chicken. I had the shrimp & grits. The shrimp were nicely cooked, but I expected more spiciness from the dish. Our main complaint,  was the lack of service. The server was not attentive, we had to ask for bread. He was nice enough,  he seemed a little lost. I don\\'t mind paying for good food, but I hate places where you feel taken advantage of. Lüke was one of those places. A chef-owned restaurant that thinks charging $27 for a BLT is justifiable, and charging full price for 11oz beers is OK. In the middle of New Orleans, where good food is everywhere, you find yourself wondering why you\\'re eating here. To add, in the middle of all this pretentiousness, the silverware was filthy and the service was awful. We were ignored for a good 15 minutes while the table next to ours was being doted on...I\\'d say save your money and go eat somewhere else in the French Quarter. The shrimp and grits were the best I had ever had. The beneits were a bit sour tasting, not to our liking. The basic egg / bacon and biscuit plate was so so. Came in for lunch during the week and went with the daily special. Service is slow but staff is friendly enough. The high ceilings make it a loud place. They can accommodate larger groups. Crab bisque is a little too heavy on the corn and almost no crab, the base is creamy and just a tad spicy which made it quite savoury. Shrimp with ham, vegetables and jasmine rice are only bearable because they come with an ok sauce, but the items separately (except the very fatty ham) are bland, really tasteless. Portions are small even for lunch, specially because there\\'s no complimentary bread or anything but given the price I guess it\\'s ok ($17). Food is OK although feel a little over-priced.  The Etoufee and smoked pork shank are good, although nothing really super to justify the price.  The desserts are good although nothing really strikes me.  I like the restaurant but at similar price I can get MUCH better food in my home town (SF Bay Area). Maybe I am just spoiled... Dining here would be cool maybe if it didn\\'t come with a side of waiters talking about how they would fuck me. Y\\'all are around a corner, my boyfriend and  I can still hear you assholes. Had breakfast there a while back, and although the scrambled eggs, biscuits were ok, the sausage and bacon was highly salted and smoked.  An acquired taste not easy to get used to, being from California.  So would not order those items again.  However, the gumbo was excellent. Happy hour is cool service is great...I feel the food is over priced... Your never sure if you never know if its worth it. Went once and I won\\'t miss not going again. Its price point makes it not worth it...over rated and over priced. Its a poor east of my per diem... Never again The happy hour oysters are reaaaaally cheap! 75cents per oyster! We had a dozen--the oysters are quite fresh and big. The shrimp and grits are average though. Got the shrimp + grits topped with crabmeat, but for a ~$40 dish... I thought it would be better? Definitely nothing special, didn\\'t even finish it.   The cocktail (champagne au poire) was also so-so, tasted rather pulpy and heavy on the sugar content.   Ambience was terrible. Usually that\\'s not a big deal if the quality of the food can redeem the place, but they seriously need to up their game in the interiors. For example, this was brunch and the whole place was super dark because they didn\\'t open any of the shutters... really?? You\\'d think that at this price point they would know better.   Acoustics were also terrible. Super loud and the screaming baby next to me didn\\'t help.   Will not be back. Very disappointed with the food and service.  When I walked in, the host stood there on the phone, ignored me.  So I stood there staring at him for nearly 3 min.  Unfriendly host put us all the way in the back room. Our server never smiled.  Maybe it\\'s New Orleans thing.  People are not friendly here overall. Popular downtown spot with good food and service. I wouldn\\'t call it special, but it was a convenient place to eat before an NBA game. We had breakfast at this restaurant today. I have to say that I found it to be a pretentious and unwelcoming. I got the southern breakfast. This included two eggs, three sausage links, biscuit, and grits for $15. The grits had a firm, congealed consistency. The links were good. The eggs were forgettable. The biscuit was cool and hard around the edges. My wife had the spicy frittata. This was pretty spicy but it was tasty. Overall, I found this place expensive and forgettable. The server, refilled our coffee once and never refilled our glasses of water. Once the food came out, she lost interest in our table. I doubt that we will return. How does a chef ruin chicken and waffles? I went for sunday brunch and the food was horrible...soggy waffles and greasy chicken. The waiter was nice and offered me another entree but I had already lost confidence.  I would not recommend it! I work in the medical field and the white lab/doctor coats the waitstaff wears, just throws me off. Also the kitchen rags they use as dinner napkins. I get it, they trying to pull something different off, right? The food was okay, not great as I heard it would be. Worth skipping and eating some place else. Coffee was quite good. The French country decor was cool. however,  limited menu, sausage a little sweet, service a tad slow even when the place was not that busy. I was really looking forward to eating here after all the suggestions.  The mint julep and old fashioned were not horrible but definitely not great.  The hamburger looked amazing but lots of bread.  Bread pudding was sadly my least favorite I\\'ve had in NOLA.  Side note baked oysters amazing and nice staff. After reading about how great the happy hour was, we decided we needed to try Luke.  We were a group of 8, headed in at 3pm for happy hour.  The food and drinks were fine, but the service was the worse.  From snooty hostess to the chippy servers, we felt unwelcome.  These are snobby people working here, they seemed annoyed they had to serve us.  Never again. Oyster happy hour is great, food is awesome! But service needs to be improved...takes forever for someone to pour water, takes forever to get the check...low standard for a tourism city. Food was good.  Tiny portions.  Service was severely lacking.  They are not quick.  Our food showed up roughly about an hour or more from time of order. Service was mediocre. Soup was great. Oyster salad was not good. It showed up cold and small for an entree salad. Not worth it. French 75 was great though. We ordered the raw oysters--they were huge, but very bland--and forgettable.  We heard great things about the chef, but can\\'t attest to anything but the oysters.  Pass. Ordered Shrimp and Grits.  Tasty, but the amount is about a small bowlful....for $22.  Salad was separate and uninspirational.    Gumbo shrimp and oyster was not fresh. Very disappointing for a John Besh restaurant. If you\\'re a gal eating alone and DARE to make a reservation and get a table, be prepared to be ignored. I had to flag a hostess down to even order a drink. Food is good and worth a wait, but I am not sure it is worth being treated Luke a second class citizen. Hello, John Besh, are you listening?? How about you, Hilton hotels?? Had the gumbo; pretty average. Seafood in it was soggy and sort of mealy.  Small but decent bar. Shrimp & grits was overpriced at $25. It tasted good, but the portion was small. The grits were cheesy.  The oysters on the half shell were a decent price. Half dozen for $9. They shuck fresh ones in front of you if you sit at the bar. Disappointing meal with slow service, average salad and dry fish. Came back to Lüke today expecting the pecan pancakes, but alas, they have changed the menu. I was disappointed but ordered the Croque Monsieur. The presentation of the sandwich was beautiful. It looked delicious. Maybe I didn\\'t like the cheese or the texture, but I wasn\\'t a fan. The French fries were good. The service was awesome, but I don\\'t like the new brunch menu! Being a first timer in New Orleans, this place was high on the list of things to try. Unfortunately, it did not meet expectations.   Our waitress was rude and acted like we were dumb each time we asked a question about the menu. We also had trouble getting her to take our order in the first place. The bread was hard and tasteless. You could get better day old bread from Jimmy Johns.   We ordered the oysters. They had a funny taste to them, yet being hungry, we ate it anyway. Later on that night I had a bad reaction from them (I am not allergic, something was just off about them).   Do not recommend. great causal chic atmosphere and awesome service.  but the food was underwhelming and overpriced, small portions, and it seemed you could get better at the millions of other restaurants in the city. Inexplicably poor food and service.  I ordered the Luke Breakfast.  The coffee was weak. The grits were salty and lukewarm. The biscuit tasted like a pillsbury pop-out-of-the-can type. My poached egg had clear egg whites and was cold. Worst meal I\\'ve had in New Orleans. My wAitress, while sweet, was clueless about the menu and returned twice to correct herself. When I asked for cane syrup sausage brought me bacon, explaining that they only have andouille sausage, which is incorrect.  In addition, when I sent the dreck back no one inquired about what was the matter nor how to fix it. The rest of our party choked down their food. Love Willa Jean but this place was a miss.  ETA-- I spoke to management on the way out and the best they could offer was that they hoped we would try them again.  Zero stars. I\\'ve eaten at some amazing places in New Orleans. This was not one of them. The staff seemed flustered, it was loud, and the food was too salty to eat. Not a fan. Good food. Slow service though. Hard to get any waiters attention for service. Water refills? You literally have to walk to a waiter for service. Waiters, when you can see them, only focus on their tables. They need to scan the room more. Food was good but the service was off. Bread wasn\\'t served until after we finished with our salads, although the beet salad was very good. And for dessert we watched our tasty ice cream melt on our bread pudding while waiting for utensils to eat with.  If they worked out the service issues it would be a four star. Also the place is noisy so not easy to carry on a conversation. My two friends and I ate here while in town on vacation. To be fair, one of my friends really enjoyed his food and it did look good. But my other friend and I ordered the crab BLT (something we would not have done if we\\'d overheard the server tell the table next to us to order something else - we\\'d already put our order in when this occurred). It was so incredibly salty that it was inedible. Neither of us could eat our meals. In hindsight, I should have sent them back although I hate making a fuss at a restaurant. But for $30-something, not being able to eat my dinner really stunk. Service other than that was great so it\\'s a shame the food didn\\'t live up to our expectations. Came here for their oyster happy hour, which is a great deal if you\\'re looking to stock up on oysters. The raw oysters were good, and wasn\\'t a huge fan of the fried ones. But didn\\'t compare well to the delicious wood fire oven ones I had the day prior at Cochon (I know, it\\'s not a fair comparison), so I walked away feeling a bit disappointed. Wouldn\\'t make a special trip here unless I was craving a ton of raw oysters. Meh. Was expecting so much more. Most of the reviews rave about the fab oyster deal (not the full menu). Like others have said, service was mediocre. Might want to work on the layout (e.g. large bags of trash carried through main dining room???). Very good food, well presented. Cut the prices and we\\'d be sold. Came for breakfast but paid like it was dinner Appetizers were very good but my entree was mediocre and everything was a bit over-priced. Will not go back unless for happy hour and appetizers only. Solid food and expensive but the service here sucked ass.  They had 3 people on the hostess stand and 2 waiters with a half empty restaurant.  Not a great use of staff. So disappointed.   French fries were cold.   Our waitress ignores us.    I would not come back.   It is highly overrated I wish I could be dishonest, but I can\\'t.  The service here is so atrocious that I\\'m perplexed beyond my wits. (the staff were arguing and cursing in front of me)  Does John Besh really own this place?   The food is good, eclectic pub food. The wait staff is hung-over, unkempt, and uninspired.  I\\'m sorry, but after 3 fair tries, I\\'ve made my final judgement.    The Burger was very good. Oysters were average. Shrimp and Grits was fine.  Review is mostly for the terrible service. Came here on a busy night and waited approximately 20 min after our reservation time, after showing up 20 min early.  Service 3 Food 4 Ambiance 3  Overall: 3.5 Stars  Had the foie gras which was good, but came with really hard garlic breadsticks, which did not go well with it. Also had some of their shrimp and shimp/grits dish.  Overall just did not feel welcome, or well taken care of compared to the other restaurants we visited on our trip. The food here is fine, particularly the oysters. It is a bit of a cliche though, modeled on a French brasserie, and from the looks of it, focus grouped and researched heavily to hit just the right demographic in the John Besh empire. But as a result, the restaurant has no soul. Food is executed well but without imagination, and the decor is generic. The faux-French posters and other decorations look like they came straight from Pier 1 Imports. There is something overly corporate about the whole experience. Went here on Thanksgiving, when I was not able to get a reservation at August.    I enjoyed my experience, but was not thrilled.  I liked the concept, German/French brasserie.  The food was comforting, and comfortably good, but not inspiring.    I ordered the shrimp farci, which disappointingly, was flash friend.  My companion had the shrimp and grits, which he enjoyed, and I\\'m told is one of their signature dishes. This review is based on service. Horrible service for our large party with reservation. It took over an hour to get our entrees and they messed up many orders. Jumbo shrimp dish was a joke. I do not recommend. The food varied from excellent (baked oysters) to inedible (profiteroles) with our entrees somewhere in between as just average. The service was off - not exactly slow, but just weird. The food, atmosphere, and service were all underwhelming for the price. If you want to try a Besh restaurant I would highly recommend Domenica instead. SO disappointed after seeing all the good reviews! Came here for breakfast while visiting NOLA and was very let down.  The biscuits were really dry and heavy, and even the eggs tasted off.  Wouldn\\'t recommend to anyone, at least not for breakfast. I had a terrible experience here on thanksgiving day. I was anticipating a fine dining experience but it was the worst. The service was poor and the food horrible. The people next to me sent their food back also. I ordered a lame version of turducken which was completely dry. The stuffing on the side was watery and soggy. The greens were so salty I had to spit it out. The waiters came to our table only twice in the evening. When they saw my untouched plate, the waiter just looked at it and took it away with out asking how everything was. They gave us some hard bread about 30 minutes after we got there. Poor poor poor. Luke is great for happy hour and dessert. For dinner there are other restaurants in the quarter that are better that have a similar cuisine and price. Service wasn\\'t great. The food was pretty good, but not nearly as good as August! Neat atmosphere, good price on raw oysters for happy hour, limited seating, touristy close to bourbon, I wouldn\\'t seek out again Not happy, the wait to get served was about 15mins to just order a drink, then they took another 10mins to come take our order, then the waiter comes back to tell me it would be an hour for them to get me six oysters because of happy hour. not for nothing the customer who is paying full price should be the priority versus the happy hour customer. I am a fan of August. Luke is good but to me it\\'s more of a burger, oyster or  breakfast place. It is not a destination restaurant in my opinion. There are places I would rather go, but if you are staying in the hotel, or live in the CBD,  it would be convenient. I was disappointed with my dinner at Luke.  I was eating solo on a Sunday night, so I sat at the bar.  The vibe was great, but most of the food was poor.  I enjoyed the Salad Luke, but the market (Drumfish) fish meuniere was awful.  It was basically an oily, fried piece of fish that lacked flavor except for the heavy dose of salt - that also permeated the accompanying vegetables.  And it seemed as though the Crispy Brussels Sprouts were prepared in the same manner.  Yes, I expected them to be fried, but these were drenched in oil and doused with salt.  I was really not happy and left more than half of each dish.  I chose not to waste time with dessert.  The service was very good. Very disappointed... waited extremely long to order drinks... ordered appetizers and one plate came out with hair and waiter acted like no big deal... finished and left!!! Horrible. We were staying at the hilton and stopped here because we were starving at 9 pm. I used to serve tables and rarely complain about service but...  Our waitress forgot to put our order in the computer ( I know because 45 minutes the first time she came back, asked for our order again and proceeded back to punch into the computer). When food finally arrived an hour and a half after walking in, it was tasteless. How do you make Cajun food tasteless in New Orleans. Thanks to Luke, I now know that every restaurant in NOLA isn\\'t amazing. I was starting to wonder since all of my other dining experiences have been amazing here. Very disappointed in the service as well as the food.  Our first night in New Orleans Luke was recommended by the hotel . Lamb was rubbery and tasteless.  Pork was over done. Adding salt didn\\'t even help the taste .  Will not get a second chance . Food is not good. We ordered Fois Gras and the toasted bread along with it came cold and old. Roasted chicken dish was oily and not tasty at all.  One good thing about the place is service, but I won\\'t come back for that. The pancakes were on point. The pecan butter in them excellent. A little pricey though for breakfast They refused to seat us despite having a reservation.  We stopped by Luke at 5 pm today for happy hour. Upon entering, we were told that they were booked up for the evening as a result of the St. Patrick\\'s Day parade. So, we stepped over to the bar to look for a seat and also went onto Open Table to see if there were reservations available. We were in luck! There was a reservation at 5:15, which we promptly booked. When we returned to the hostess stand, they told us that they weren\\'t honoring Open Table reservations. Why be on Open Table then?   This is not the first time they have pretended to be fully booked when trying to walk in. Last time at least they honored the reservation. Not a huge fan of this place.  I\\'ve been all over New Orleans, but didn\\'t think the restaurant was worth the price.   1.  We got the fried oyster, avocado salad.  It was incredibly overdressed, to the point of soggy leaves at the end.  But good flavor. 2.  I got the gumbo, yummy but not dissimilar to more affordable places 3.  burger, good but not amazing.  Fries were a bit cold and had to ask for a new side.  They weren\\'t crispy either, a little soggy. What was the strangest thing was that it was really difficult to get a reservation, but when we went--the restaurant wasn\\'t full! Ate Xmas dinner at Luke with my wife. We were made to sit at the bar though a good amount of tables were empty the whole time we were there. Horrible service at the bar. Both of our meals came out undercooked (burger and mussels).    I\\'ve had a decent lunch there in the past, but won\\'t be going back. I have added a star to the review for the restaurant reaching out to ask about my experience.  Any restaurant that is looking to improve its customer experience deserves a second look - the next time I am in New Orleans I will do so. I ordered the ribeye and it wasn\\'t anything too exciting. Don\\'t get me wrong, it was good but definitely something I could\\'ve cooked at home minus the $34. My waitress was also very pushy and seemed to be in such a rush to get my mom and I out of the restaurant. One time stop only Breakfast. The breakfast sandwich is actually a breakfast burger. The shrimp and grits is creamy, well seasoned and delicious. Come hungry if you choose to spend some dough on your first meal of the day. Not worth the hype. The prices are higher than other places and the food is ok had better. Nice ambiance however the service was poor. The servers seem to have a bit of an attitude and not fully understand the meaning of good customer service. We put in our order 50 minutes ago. We ordered the burrata salad, shrimp and grits, crispy Brussels sprouts, and flammenkuchen. We asked our waiter to bring the plates as they were ready. 50 minutes and nothing has come out. AND ITS MY BIRTHDAY. To top it off the staff just seemed annoyed that we mentioned we were hungry. They brought over two more rolls.  I don\\'t want to get full on bread.   Our waiter did give us two glasses of champagne after he saw my hangry face. Luke is a let down compared to Besh\\'s other restaurants. The food is german diner style with seafood? I am confused. The happy hour on raw oysters is pretty good, but how hard is it to serve food you literally don\\'t cook... Wow. So disappointed as it was the first John Besh restaurant I tried and it didn\\'t meet any of my expectations at all.  None of the food was memorable, in fact, some of it was simply bad. The frites came out cold and instead of replacing them they tried to re-fry them into brown sticks of starch - ugh.  The bartender didn\\'t know how to serve pastis - in a French Brasserie?  Food was cold or delayed. The server forgot drinks. And, nothing tasted great.   Sadly, there are too many other good restaurants in NOLA I would try again before here. Damn, I really like John Besh, too. Disinterested service. Slow food preparation. Food was good but not great. Looks like besh set this place up and has never come back. The food was good but not great.  A bit overpriced for the food and the lack of atmosphere.  Also, when we were there on a rather busy night, it felt very chain-like.  Still, I\\'d give it another shot and go between 3-6 for the oysters. The oysters were great and the service good. However the schnitzel and side dishes were small.  We talked to the water but he charged us for another side dish. The red cabbage was not very tasty, not enough gravy and the spatzle Were at a premium . Overall it was just ok. Go for the oysters. Poor quality Sunday breakfast/brunch service for a messily party of 3. Would have liked to try the food, but we couldn\\'t even get served water within 20 minutes so we left. Won\\'t be returning for sure. Went to Palace Cafe instead (which I highly recommend for Sunday brunch). This pertains to breakfast only:  The one time I\\'ve had breakfast here, it wasn\\'t anything special.  I would have been happier with Waffle House.  I\\'m not saying it was bad.  Given some level of expectation, it should have been somewhat better than an average breakfast offering. The service was very good. The food was yummy, but a bit salty. I enjoyed this restaurant and would go again but was no my favorite in New Orleans where there are so many good restaurants! Had breakfast.  Average french press coffee, wife got yogurt and granola which was overpriced for $12. I got the egg white fritata which was excellent.  Overall I would want to come back but restaurant was average on this visit. I had the Monday special, a fried pork chop with polenta and wilted greens. The wilted greens are the southern kind...bitter and vaguely smoky.  They serve the mains in these cast iron camp dishes.  We also had the roasted beet salad and a cup of mozzo ball soup to share.  All of this was good but HEAVY.  I felt sort of dizzy after. That might also have something to do with the fact that this was one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to in my life. My bf was a big fan of the windowed kitchen...he was rapt in his man-crushes on all the chefs working the line. Lots of flame-cooked stuff in there. Romantic this dinner was not. The experience overall was very disappointing. I ordered the entouffee and the dish was very salty and could not finish even half of it. The oysters were fresh and large in size.   The service was unsatisfactory. The restaurant was not busy but we were seated near the door next to a really loud table. service nor food not up to New Orleans standards. our waiter was nice but everyone else was surley. you can get just as good breakfast for less Just tried this place based on the past reviews and I have to say I am sadly disappointed. It wasn\\'t the service that was the issue is was more the quality of the food. We tried the foie gras and there were more ingredients added (slight balsamic reduction and a gelatin that tasted like lychee) to it that one couldn\\'t even taste or appreciate it. My wife had the entrecôte (ribeye) and I had the canard roti. Unfortunately the duck wasn\\'t very palatable and was over seasoned and the skin was rubbery. The ribeye was adequate but nothing special. I sadly can not recommend this place. Food was ok but not the same for service, it took forever for me to be seated despite the fact that there were several empty tables available. Easily worst gumbo of my life.  Service was pretty poor too.  This place is supposed to to be fancy but you can find better almost anywhere on bourbon street.  DONT EAT HERE!!! Worst experience I\\'ve had in a restaurant in my entire life. Staff were rude from the moment we walked in the door. Obviously has just become a tourist trap where they no longer care about delivering customer service. Wine list is horrible. Enjoyed the pate appetizer but that was about it All we wanted were some good happy hour oysters. Takes way too long for naked oysters. Better off going somewhere else Service can be spotty - Don\\'t let them out you in the back- the whole point of a bistro  is to have a bistro experience. great Happy Hour- and French 75s Disappointed that 5 minutes after we entered, I was told to not laugh as loud while sitting at the bar. It\\'s 9pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant is half full. Not a positive atmosphere. Literally worse service I have ever had at an upscale restaurant. They lost our order, brought wrong food, brought right food cooked wrong, and then manger was rude. We will never ever go back and never recommend it. Only reason for 2 stars was a decent steak my boyfriend had. I don\\'t think I\\'ll return to Luke.  The boiled shrimp were over-cooked; the white wine was only slightly chilled (needed ice); and the seafood gumbo, while tasty, was overloaded with okra and sausage...too many other better options in this city. We came here for the oyster happy hour, and I think that\\'s the only thing this place is really good for. I had gotten half a dozen raw and half a dozen fried. Both were good. However, any of their other food is generic and forgettable. For the price of the happy hour, the place is not bad, oysters were fine (I think I preferred the fried, though usually raw is my jam), and the drinks were strong enough. However, I didn\\'t care much for the gruff persona of our server, or how quickly they would disappear. We weirdly had two servers, yet somehow it was hard to flag either down. It\\'s not on my return list, but I wouldn\\'t say no if others wanted to go. It was good however when you order medium be ready for medium rare on the ribeye.  All and all it was OK Hello. Just a heads up about our visit this morning for brunch.   The hostess was on her cell phone when we arrived.  We had to wait for her to finish her text before we got greeted.  At that time she seemed annoyed that she had to take care of us.  This in turn set a negative tone for our visit.  I saw her on her phone while others arrived as well.  I am shocked by the lack of professionalism at a well established restaurant.  While I won\\'t be back, I thought this needed to be shared.  The food was decent- the housemade sausage was the best thing we had. When I first called to get reservations the young lady told me there was no room for reservations until 1030. We decided to walk just to check it out and when we got here they had an empty table for 4.    We looked at the menu and we were not excited with the menu. I was excited to try some of the previously posted item but to my demise they were not available. We did try some of the appetizers and drinks.   I had the Bee in your Bonnet: not bad and would recommend it. Also had the Brussel sprouts and the au gratin which was good but not orgasmic.   Overall, it can be skipped. Was looking forward to eating here, was not easy to get a reservation. I had the hamburger, it was cooked perfectly however the flavor was lacking. Service was good. Arrived at Luke\\'s late in the evening on Christmas day. Not sure if it was an off day for them, or if we had arrived too late, but for a restaurant with four stars on Yelp, it was sadly very disappointing!   We wanted the special of the day, which they had run out of, and settled instead for the fresh gulf fish and a bowl of gumbo.  The gulf fish was okay, but nothing to write home about. The gumbo was by far the most disappointing -- it came lukewarm at best, which quickly turned to cold. Also, the gumbo lacked any discernible seafood and instead was filled with sausages?   It was a disappointing start to our food adventures in New Orleans, but luckily the exception rather than the norm. Absolutely awful customer service. Had a 2:30 reservation and was told we had to be out by 4:30 for a large party. Service was extremely slow and food was average. Don\\'t waste your money. The food was fair, wait staff nice but service was poor and it is quite expensive. The food was quite disappointing, but the atmosphere and presentation were good.  Staff was attentive. The crab-stuffed shrimp entree had 4 smallish shrimp, with a ball of stuff around each (with no - at least, no apparent  - crab).  The fish entree (meuniere) was incredibly salty.  We ordered house pinot grigo; the wine was not very good; when we got the bill, we learned that the waiter had served us $12 glasses of riesling (note: wine is served in juice glasses).  The side of asparagus contained pieces of asparagus, rather than spears, served in a soup-cup bowl. The veggies served with the entrees were good.  I would never go back.  The J.W. Marriott staff should stop recommending this restaurant. I expected nothing short of fabulous. I ordered the Luke Salad with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat as an addition. Sadly I had to pick some black leaves out of the greens and the crabmeat was nowhere near jumbo lump. Extremely disappointed. I really hate to say anything bad about this place because I know people who work there, but this is one of the most overrated restaurants in the city. This place has got to be kept alive by tourists who don\\'t know any better. The building, of course, is beautiful, the service is great, but the food? No. Go elsewhere. Went in to make a reservation, was told that the wait was 2 hour and that they would text us when the reservation was ready. That was perfectly fine. As we grew more hungry, hour 3 came around, still no text saying that our table was ready. We called in asking if there was a table available, the lady rudely snuffed it off saying that we should have stayed in the area. Guess service wasn\\'t all that it was hyped up to be. Here\\'s what you need to know: oysters from the Gulf are nothing like the oysters you\\'re used to getting from the East or West Coasts. They don\\'t have the same complexity, the same salinity. They\\'re still good, but they\\'re especially good deep fried in the batter that Lüke uses for their fried oysters. Head that way for happy hour and see what I mean. We went there around 9 pm on Saturday without reservation. We stopped at this restaurant on the way back to our hotel. I ordered seafood gumbo, which was tasty, maybe a bit salty, and it didn\\'t have any seafood in it except some shrimp. The service was awful. Once we were seated, nobody came to our table except taking our order and delivering out food. Other tables were getting all the attentions. I don\\'t know whether we didn\\'t order expensive food, or we arrived late, or we dressed casually. But we were complete ignored. I can see that their food is good, but I don\\'t think I want to come back to this place again. Awful. I ordered a bowl of muscles. More than half were undercooked. including the ones that were open. They also weren\\'t properly cleaned and the entire bowl was grainy. Only reason it deserves a star is because of the fries. My wife and I just stopped here to try to get dessert. They had a bunch of tables open as well as seats at the bar. Somehow they wouldn\\'t be able to seat us, but had tables open for reservation when we checked online after leaving. All we wanted was bread pudding :( Food is very fresh and delicious, and service was quite poor, which lowered our rating. Fruits de mer was good and a very nice selection with excellent jumbo Gulf shrimp. Brussels sprouts tasty but over priced, chowder exquisite.  Bread pudding light and rich. Hard to find service people on a Thursday night. Our server was really great and the food was pretty tasty as well. The reason why I\\'m giving it three stars out of five is because the ambiance was very loud. They have a cabinet next to the hostess stand which holds all of their silverware and about every five minutes you\\'d hear ridiculously loud noises of forks,spoons,etc. being dropped on the floor or being thrown into a drawer in the cabinet. I know it might sound petty but it\\'s really annoying when you\\'re trying to hold a conversation with someone. Dinner @ Lukes was a total disappointment.  Bad Yelp -  you lead me astray!  Even though we had a reservation, we were stuck at a small corner table near 2 large corporate dinners so it was very loud. The atmosphere was average.   The menu did not have all that many options so I settled on the shrimp and grits which was too spicy, a small portion and not all that great.  I forget what my husband had but he was equally disappointed.  Service was inattentive and slow.    NOT Recommended Tried for a second time to eat this place. Both times I never received my food. the first time was 60 minutes of waiting for my order which I never received. The second time was 90 minutes. This time they simply forgot to make it. Organization at this place is not existent. attitude is equally as bad. On a side note...avoid the Hilton Hotel it is attached to as well.   I\\'ve ate here last and it was adequate. Staff was rude but the food was okay. Staff is still rude. Food? Avoid this joint at all cost. Doesn\\'t state anywhere that reservations are highly recommended! Arrived at 5 & was told next available seating was 8pm?! Unbelievable! Ready to spend $100s! Good location but not great food for breakfast I went to Luke based on great reviews of it for dinner. I didn\\'t experience great food for breakfast, however. I ordered a standard breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, and a biscuit. The food was very bland, and the biscuit didn\\'t come with jam or butter until I asked for it. Otherwise the service was rapid, and the waiter was nice. If you\\'re looking for a good breakfast, try elsewhere. I was here last week for breakfast. The food was good. My mother loved the pancakes with berry cane syrup. I had the southern breakfast, with the cane syrup sausage, which were delicious.           However, the service was terrible. Our sever was very nice, but he seemed to be the only server for the entire dining room. It took almost half an hour just to get a coffee refill. There were several people in server outfits just standing around. We asked one of them to bring water for the table, but it never came. I would give this place another try based on the food, but there are too many good restaurants in New Orleans to waste time and money on bad service. I ordered the LÜKE BREAKFAST:  TWO EGGS COOKED ANY STYLE, BACON, HOUSE-MADE ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE, BUTTERMILK BISCUIT GRITS.  It was so rich that I was sick for two days. The bacon looked like it was deep fried which I have never seen before. The sausage did not taste like andouille. I didn\\'t eat it.   I would not recommend. Went for Happy Hour!! Great prices, but couldn\\'t enjoy after spending the last 3 nights in New Orleans. Oysters were huge and we both had the shrimp and grits. It was really heavy, but tasty!! I would definitely try something else next time. The food here is good but compare to Nola standard I think this place mediocre, a 3 star and not 4. There are many other restaurant in this area that offer better items on their menu Didn\\'t even get to sit. The place was half empty when we came with a party of 8 (bachelor\\'s party). We were in sports gear for our bike tour after brunch.  Hostess proceeded to inform us they can\\'t take a party of 8. When I asked if she can split us into parties of 4, she had a peculiar look and proceeded to let us know, politely, that she\\'s \"actually\" all booked through Mardi Gras and can\\'t take walk ins.  -.-\"    Not sure if it\\'s the dress code or our ethnicity, but I\\'ll give the benefit of the doubt and assume the former.   If there was a strict dress code, they should\\'ve been upfront with it.   It goes without saying that we were a group of polite professionals with two officers with us Menu is ho-hum, especially for the price. I made the mistake of ordering this onion tart that reminded me of a bbq chicken pizza from CPK. Should\\'ve picked up that the waiter wasn\\'t as enthused when I ordered but didn\\'t dissuade me (too subtle for me at the time, but understandable behavior from him). Gezellig sfeervol restaurant met aardige bediening. Flamenkuche was koud bij het opdienen. De openkeuken liet ons zien dat hij opnieuw de oven inging en hierna droog was. Ander hoofgerecht bleek iets anders te zijn dan besteld. Voor ons dus een tegenvaller. Als \"compensatie\" werd hoofdgerecht en drankjes niet in rekening gebracht Disappointing.  We went for brunch on a Saturday after reading some good reviews here.  The food was ok but overpriced for what it was, especially a dozen TINY West Coast oysters for $45. But the real issue here was the service or the lack there of.  We had to chase the waiter down several times to refill water glasses and to find out why 1 appetizer came out right away but we waited 10 minutes for the oysters and Bloody Mary\\'s.  Burgers were ordered rare and medium but came out well with cold fries. We assume the problem was the burgers were cooked before the appetizers were even delivered to the table.  Overall, can\\'t recommend when there are so many better options in New Orleans! While the service was good, the shrimp and grits were just ok. This is an upscale restaraunt, if you want good shrimp in grits, I would suggest you go elsewhere While the food was ok, I am not accustomed to begging for a coffee refill. I do not like being treated as if I am invisible. Food...excellent.  Service, extremely subpar for such a highly-rated establishment.  Service in need of repair. Last night, I ordered Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" at Luke. After the first bite, I could tell the shrimp was mushy. But I didn\\'t believe that a highly rated restaurant and a $25 dish would serve shrimps that were not fresh. I still finished my dinner. One hour later, I got rashes on my whole body and it was very itchy. It happens when I eat bad shrimps and I need to take an allergy pill to relieve it. I feel deeply disappointed with this restaurant. Will never go back again. Lively atmosphere and very friendly bartender. $0.50 cent oysters during happy hour. This restaurant disappointed - given it has 4 stars on Yelp and $$. It should really be 3 stars and $$$. Really too expensive for what you get. I was glad they were open on xmas, but that meant a more expensive menu with even less choice. The shrimp and grits was pretty tasty, as were the mussels, but other things disappointed. The worst offender was the Bibb lettuce salad (not sure how they messed up a salad, but they did) and the overly salty french fries. And the matzoh ball soup was just awful - but then again, why did I order that at a french brasserie? Probably because it was 30 degrees underneath the A/C (which they claimed they couldn\\'t turn down because it\\'s controlled by the hotel they are in). Breakfast this morning -- mediocre.  Restaurant was dark and smelly.  Eggs were cold.  Coffee lukewarm at best.  The morning at Luke has cast a pall over the day. Had the onion flatbread as an appetizer and was impressed.  Jalapeno shrimp & grits was exceptional as well as the BLT with fried soft shell crab. After eating - luckily after eating - watched bartender open large jar of olives and pick out with bare hands to skewer as condiment for martini\\'s.  Three olives per skewer - she must have done 100 of them with her bare hands while handling cash, credit cards and register and then back to touching the olives. Dined here on a Friday night at 5:00.  Not busy but our waitress was extremely inattentive.  My husband\\'s Cabernet was served in a juice glass filled to the brim, but about 2\" wide.  Definitely set the tone for what continued to be a disappointing meal.  My skate wing could have been good if it were not greasy and soaked in sauce.  Husband gives a \"2\" a great disappointment. Have been to Besh\\'s August many times, as a couple, foursome and large groups. Never less than xlnt. At Luke we were seated promptly. Wine service: had to practically beg for the white which was tables away. Was still on appetizer when server tried to place the main dish on the table. Couldn\\'t be dissuaded so all on table at same time. My fish dish xlnt, partner\\'s (same dish) mealy and inedible, ?old, refrozen?? Gumbo highly recommended by waitress had enuf seafood, but was bland, not New Orleans style. Hope this was an off night Did not complain as we did not want to offend the other couple. Yah, definitely stick to the oyster for happy hour only. The other stuff is not a good deal. Went here and sat at the bar to dine alone. Food was good, wine pour was way short and service was terrible. The bartender was extremely rude from the moment I sat down. I am in the hospitality industry so I try to be extra nice to those in the service business. Well, this girl didn\\'t want to have anything to do with me. She seemed annoyed that I even sat there to begin with. I had to ask twice for my wine and where I sat (only seat available at bar) was sticky so I asked for it to be wiped down. She never smiled and couldn\\'t get rid of me fast enough. There are many other restaurants that have great food so I will not come back here or recommend to anyone else. I had much higher hopes for a Besh restaurant. I went for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty crowded and very noisy. The best part of my meal was my cocktail. The experience only went downhill from there. The waiter was slow and not very attentive. Tables that ordered ten min. after got their food five minuets before me. My sandwich was poorly cooked. Too hard on the outside and too soft on the inside. My boyfriend disliked his meal too. I think the restaurant tries to to mix too many food types. German and Cajun and French and Southern.... just not good enough for a Besh More than a 2 hour wait for our meal. Mediocre and overpriced, but good service. Service was very slow, over 3 hours for dinner. I had the ribeye, cooked med rare, asked for med. steak was this and grizzly with no seasoning. Potatoes were cold,crawfish bisque was a way to salty. The menus didn\\'t have a selection that looked exciting food to me. They seem to put an ingredient on everything to make it different, just not appetizing to me Don\\'t walk in to this place without a reservation. 7:18 on a Monday night, open tables, open barstools - asked about dinner for two.  Was told no way until at least 9. Not offered seat at bar - just \"no\". Good luck. Looked decent, guess we\\'ll never know.  Nope, not giving them a second chance. I don\\'t understand the big deal.  Told 45 minute wait on a weekday at 4. My friend made a reservation thru Yelp after we walked in and that got us seated in 20 minutes. None of us liked the half price specialty drinks. The Brussels sprouts were tasty as were the fried oysters, but honestly we had better at cheaper restaurants. We had the lamb dish and the shrimp and grits which were both served piping hot. Our server was pleasnt but very busy! The service was terrible. The waiter brought our food and never came back to check in us. The oysters were terrible. They were not shucked to order. We told the waiter and he said that happens when it\\'s busy. We told the manager who apologized and took them off our bill. I will never eat there again! Just checked in at Luke\\'s, apparently they can\\'t combine two 2 seater  tables for a Grp of three because the restaurant closes at 11 and last call for food is 10:30....  Food is important and so, is the customer and when it\\'s almost restaurant closing time, you can always do a lil more coz the crowd flowing in is less... I have been to Luke many times for breakfast and thought it was so great.  Took my sisters out tonight for dinner and it was an embarrassment!  Service was not good.  No review of the menu, no offering of specials. My ribeye was 80% fat and cold, as were my potatoes.  Im not happy and wont return.    If you eat there, go for breakfast.  Dinner was terrible. This is my third time at Luke. Not a great experience this time due to careless service. He didn\\'t write down my orders. We had to ask for services from other random servers.   Crawfish bisque  Matzo Ball & Roast Chicken Soup (not my fav) Blue Crab  1/2 Dozen of Louisiana Shrimp cocktail Fried oyster salad (not my fav) Chicken tender and French Fried Apple juice( didn\\'t make it for this table) Pâté of Louisiana Rabbit & Chicken Livers (didn\\'t make to the table) We came here for happy hour. The raw oyster is smaller than ACME. There is no non alcoholic menu and the coke is 3.75 and NO REFILLABLE. Very disappointed and will not recommended to anyone. With rock star status,  New Orleans Chef John Besh serves up amatuer garage band grub at Luke.  Is he peddling some sort of  Alsatian - Creole - Black Forest - Bistro grub?  Who knows; I don\\'t get it.  On a recent visit to Luke, my red fish was served coated with a soggy batter and covered with a tasteless dollop of lump crab meat.  The desert of bread pudding was swimming in an overwhelming praline sauce, making this New Orleans staple virtually unrecognizable.  The waitstaff look silly in white tunics.  Is this place REALLY a John Besh restaurant?  Having previously dined at August (another Besh venture), I find Luke to be terribly disappointing ... completely incongruent with Besh\\'s reputation.  NOLA has much better to offer within easy walking distance (away) from Luke. One and done! Rushed and spotty service in a cramped space with pedestrian room temperature food! Not sure who has been giving the good reviews Greet food but the service is terrible. .we cant eat pork and we ordered the shrimp and grits after the waiter assured to us that they can do it without. Guess what..other waiter brought the order and said without pork but it has. We returned it and after few minutes they brought us one as ordered. Normal restaurants send a manger to apologize or get the order off the check or at least provide something complimentary. ..this place did nothing of that... Nothing special , average classic American concept food . It is not a restaurant gives you good after delish memorable   taste . You can experience this restaurant for one time and nothing special about it Disclaimer: This review is solely based upon a few cocktails, oysters on the half shell, and pomme frites.    I enjoyed Luke\\'s happy hour. As my dining companion put it, \"Luke is the John Besh restaurant for the working class.\" Nestled nicely in the dining dearth of the CBD, seer sucker clad businessmen and women are of great attendance here. Oysters are 50 cents, cocktails (originally priced under 10) are half off between the hours of 3-6 pm.   The champagne au peche, St. Charles Streetcar cocktails were tasty, but not as stiff as I would have preferred. The oysters were fresh but lacked anything to accompany them (such as crackers). We asked for bread and solved this problem. The pomme frites rank third on my pomme frites Nola list.    Overall, very enjoyable. We were seated immediately with a reservation. The food was good, but there are lots of places for good seafood in New Orleans. Despite having two servers I felt like there were long periods of waiting to order, waiting for our drinks, waiting for the plates to be cleared. For the price, I just wanted more. Overpriced touristy fare served up on crisp white table cloth. The waiters are either imbeciles or criminally indifferent; they have the competence and sophistication of C minus middle-school students suffering from chronic ADD. I guess that\\'s what they mean by living in NOLA: working at Luke is the Big Easy. Leave Luke to the wide-eyed travelers from East Cleveland and go to Mother\\'s across the street. Order yourself the Charlie Stevens Bloody Mary. After a visit to Luke, you\\'ll need it. My business partner and I had lunch at Luke yesterday and it was terrible. We ordered the tuna and Brussels Sprouts appetizers to start off with. The Brussel Sprouts were hard and under cooked and the tuna was nothing special. My friend ordered the soft shell crab sandwich for his meal and I had the burger. His soft shell crabs were greasy and so were the fries that came with it. My burger was over cooked, the cheese was burnt and it was barely edible. We were in a hurry so sending everything back and complaining to get new food wasn\\'t an option. All I know is this will be the last time I go here for any meal. Fish was overcooked. Service was pretty bad too. I told them of a food allergy, but the food came out with said ingredient on the plate. They agreed to remake the food. By the time my food actually came out, everyone had to leave to get back to a work event (and we were there for 1.5 hours, so it\\'s not like they didn\\'t have enough time!). The servers and managers came over and apologized profusely, but they did not offer any compensation: e.g. dessert, drinks, a free meal. Talk is cheap. Luke is not cheap... and not cheap enough to warrant this kind of service and food. Hmmm. Went here during happy hour with my fiancée. We made reservations (I highly recommend this or you\\'ll be standing forever hoping by some miracle you\\'ll get a coveted spot at the bar). So all was well. We were seated, ordered drinks and a dozen oysters (75 cents, baby!) And half-priced beer and wine? Awesome! We then ordered the flammenkuchen. My god, so good. So much bacon. Do this! But then!!! Things took a dramatic nosedive when we ordered another round of drinks and oysters. Boom, the 5-star service/experience disappeared. Our waiter basically abandoned us, and we waited no less than 45 minutes before we finally got our second round. They did apologize, but come on. Not sure what happened, but know this place can be, very quickly, hit and miss. Still, those oysters were amaaaaazing. We went here because the reviews were all excellent. While the service was good the food was just ok. Not impressed. If your normal is macaroni grill you will like it. If you are a foodie you will be disappointed Not my favorite Besh experience. My gulf fish was fine, but my boyfriend\\'s burger was bizarre. I\\'m not sure if it is intended to be eaten open face, but that is how it was served. It seemed like an odd way to serve such a large burger. Service was a little slow, but given how busy the restaurant was, not unexpected or unusual. The waitress was a bit...off. She openly flirted with my boyfriend, which made for an awkward dining experience considering my parents were present (maybe she thought we were siblings, but event then, still very odd behavior). Overall, my food was fine, and service was average; though, I\\'ll stick to Besh\\'s other restaurants. I have eaten at the Luke in San Antonio, which was top notch. So when a friend wanted to go during our recent trip to NOLA, I didn\\'t hesitate. I wish I did.  Every single one of our dishes were extremely salty. One of us had the burger and the other had the shrimp and grits. We couldn\\'t finish our food after a few bites because it was so salty. And sadly, we both got sick for a few hours after leaving Luke\\'s.   I was hoping for the same performance I received at the San Antonio location but was greatly disappointed. I will never visit the NOLA location when I visit the city again. The NOLA location could learn a lot from the Texas location. Oysters are fresh and only $0.75 each during happy hour, but shell chips left on oysters and ruin the texture. Grill oysters are good at taste but too oily. Fried oysters are over cooked and too salty. One star for the price and fresh oyster, another star for the service and environment. Just went for a late dinner. Our appetizer was never put in and when we inquired about it, it showed up with our meal. Disappointed in the dinner visit. Interested in trying out breakfast/brunch. Nice enough restaurant. Excellent service and ambience, but I wasn\\'t floored by the food. I went in with the expectation for real Cajun, New Orleans food so that might of been what messed me up. If your after authenticity, try something else. But if you just want a nice meal in a nice place, give it try. I felt like I wasted my time to come here I am not interested in raw oysters. I was under the impression they had other oysters they sold in singles by themselves. Quite a walk from French Quarter to come here. The selection of the cocktails is very very very minimal I was confused why that is.  This is more of a place to go if you\\'re staying at a hotel nearby and don\\'t want to go out of your way. The entrées looked good but they\\'re very small and pricey I came for happy hour I was disappointed they didn\\'t have a bigger selection. I am disappointed with my experience at Luke. Reviews tallying 4 stars suggested a good experience, but i must not have ordered the right thing- the organic quinoa bowl. The bowl is cold- quinoa and roasted vegetables. The poached egg was warm and perfect, but the salad came smothered in a horseradish dressing. It may not have been that bad, but horseradish was never mentioned in the menu, so it was a surprise and WAY too overwhelming. The cheese was tasteless and the many many cherry tomatoes were mostly over- ripe and squishy.  I won\\'t return since there are so many great restaurants in NOLA. Not my favorite place.  It\\'s waaay expensive for simple foods.   It\\'s like Zea\\'s except that they charge double!  My friends love the oysters and oyster prices, but I\\'m just not an oyster person. I went for Happy Hour oysters over French Quarter fest weekend and definitely got my money\\'s worth from the food. Four dozen oysters, a sandwich and drinks between two of us came out to be around $60.   We called ahead and were assured that we had to get there early or they couldn\\'t accommodate us, which might have been because it was FQF weekend, but the place was empty upon our arrival and had plenty of seats available when we left.  Being rushed in early and the attitude that accompanied that cost them a star in my review when added to the \"lukewarm\" service (sorry, couldn\\'t resist).    I\\'d go back again when I can spare the time (shucking oysters takes a while) and when they can offer to accommodate me at an hour that doesn\\'t make me feel like I\\'m too late for lunch and too early for dinner. It was a busy Monday night. Service was spotty. Our fries were cold and limp, the steak underdone. Drinks and oysters were good though. If you like salty food, get the shrimp and grits. Service was awful! Food was probably good but because the waiter served it cold we were unimpressed. Unfortunately the fella that served our table was training a new waiter so don\\'t expect the service to improve. We had to ask who our waiter was after 15 minutes with no service. We weren\\'t offered bread that other tables had. SIL asked for his beer to be served with his meal and it didn\\'t come until he has finished his meal.  On the positive side the crab bisque was nice and hot and delicious. I had high expectations based on reviews for this place. The service (in my opinion) was NOT good although we were assigned 2 different people (Kevin and Chi). Every time we had a question or needed something we had to flag them down. Odd, it was a Tuesday and not overly crowded. The crab bisque was amazing. However, they served a cup when we asked for a bowl. Quickly rectified this though and served us a bowl. The baked oysters were good, the pasta I absolutely would do without. I wouldn\\'t revisit, it\\'s not worth the money to deal with LESS THAN GREAT service and okay food. Food was just okay. We had the schnitzel and it was tough and overlooked. Service was slow, didn\\'t get our first drinks until after the appetizer was served. Overall felt rushed. Came here for dinner and had very unfriendly service. Two people at our table\\'s food was cold when served to us, so we asked for them to take it back and heat it up...They only took one person\\'s ignoring the second person. When they returned the second person asked again for them to heat up their food.   The tablecloths had paper on top, which was not classy at all and reminded me of a cheap family restaurant.   Was not impressed with our visit. This was very mediocre in my opinion! The service was just okay, the courses were way too spread out, and the food was very okay. For what we spent, I can think of a hundred other restaurants I would have rather gone to. Sorry, Lüke - this place just did not meet expectations.  It\\'s a white tablecloth kind of place, with waiters dressed in crisp shirts and black vests and ties. The items on the menu are a little pricey, so I decided to go with the Tabasco and honey fried chicken biscuit, a smaller dish, with a side of grits.  Though the biscuit and chicken were good, I wasn\\'t wowed. The food was lukewarm, which made the grits kind of hard to swallow.   Don\\'t get me wrong - I think it\\'s good food, but compared to everything else in the area, it\\'s just not /as/ good. Tried to walk in without a reservation and told to try the bar (which was full) and not offered a wait time. Considering we were dressed appropriately (dress for the lady, collared shirt for the gentleman), this felt unwelcoming. We went across the street to Trenasse and had an amazing dinner with no wait. Not what I expected.   Good food, great service but you have to have a reservation! No walking up to this place. Not the most amazing food, service or atmosphere- there are so many more amazing places to eat and experience. Was solid but just not worth the high price tag overall. I\\'m not a big one star type of guy, but in this case it\\'s deserved. The level of chaos and poor manners from the hostess to waitstaff, servers to manager and even the servers to customers was so severe we left, after being seated and before ordering.  A server was loudly verbally trashing a patron to the manager, who obviously had no control, at the check in area, while the hostess rolled her eyes to us, clearly indicating this wasn\\'t out of the ordinary.   These behaviors continued until after we had been seated. After getting up and beginning to walk out, one of the servers yelled \"What? How y\\'all going to leave?\" across the restaurant, confirming our decision to escape.  Hopefully, someone will read this and do some much needed hospitality training. The stuffed oysters were good. However our waiters were rude. I probably will not recommend to others due to the bad experience. Very overrated  and It was underwhelming based on the great reviews. Service was good, but the food took a long time. We had the fried oyster salad and it was bland. The Brussels were ok, I think it was trying too hard with so many ingredients on it. The shrimp etoufee had nice flavor but wish it wasn\\'t served as a pasta dish. Portions are quite large here. I\\'m giving Luke 2 stars.  The food was just ok.  But the service was not what I expected at all.  Coming to my home town and seeing for myself how the staff here is Chy St crazy to me.  We had to be moved because the air condition was dripping water on my back. So not cool. I hope when I come back it will be much better.... Chow for now Good food but service was bad. We had two servers - one was decent and the other not good - very casual attitude and didn\\'t seem liked he had ever been trained. We were offered a dessert menu, accepted, but no menu ever came. Definitely over rated. Waited well over an hour for dry duck.  Tried NoLa a couple days ago and their duck was several orders of magnitude better. Maybe it was the day of the week we went (Monday) or maybe the time of day (12ish), but the place wasn\\'t anything special, just blah.  The waiters could smile a little more, but service was okay.  I got the croque madame, hubby got some ham? roast beef? sandwich, and wanted to get our little one mac & cheese - but they were out of cheddar???!...so a basic grilled cheese was out too...Is this a serious restaurant?  The ham was a bit salty so overwhelmed both our meals, and I\\'m not so sure the bread was fresh.  First impressions count, so won\\'t be coming here again. I see why they call it Luke\\'s..... everything was LUKE WARM. Waste of money and time. Food tasted like it was cooked 2 days ago. I could of made a better breakfast with 1 arm tied behind my back. These guys make 1 good thing. A big honking burger with lots of meat and bacon. It\\'s satisfying to say the least. They also have great parmesan fries here.   Other then that a very small menu. If you\\'re looking for a burger in the land of creole, go here! I wanted to try this place after reading reviews and looking for some classy Louisiana fare.  I hadn\\'t visited a John Besh restaurant before, and went with rather high expectations.  I started with the baked oysters, which were delicious.  For a main course, I ordered a steak, which was cooked right (medium) but was brought to the table at about room temperature.  My wife ordered a burger well done, it came out very red...however, they did correct that mistake with no hassle.  For the price, I\\'d expect better. Amazing oysters , during HH it is only .75 each.   I also ordered crawfish bisque, basically no crawfish.. my bf ordered shrimp jumbo, portion is really small... Everything tasted ok, but since I had a really high expectation to this place, it turned out to be just ordinary. OK, the food tastes great and the service is good.  However the portion and price of the chicken soup were completely ridiculous.  The bowl was only dampened with the soup at the bottom. We went to Luke for dinner. The room smelled subtly (and pleasantly) of sauerkraut when we walked in. The menu has German influences as well as local ingredients and dishes. We had the Wednesday special (Shrimp Creole) and the Moules  et Frites. Both were great. The mussels were some of the best I\\'ve had in a while - very fresh and flavorful.   Service was just OK - attentive, but we felt like we were being rushed, and our server seemed impatient. Used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Just went there and the waitress forgot to put my boudin order in. When I got it I didn\\'t like it and wanted to order something else. I was told the kitchen was closed. I was seated at 10:15. Restaurant closes at 11. Got the Boudin at 11:10. I ate crackers and butter because I was hungry. Currently under renovation. We arrived and their computers are down and won\\'t be able to seat us for an hour...argh. and no other customers are waiting I tried this place twice prior to COVID. Management and hostesses were rude and unaccomodating. The oyster shuckers and bartenders were nice and friendly. I might give it another try soon to see if it has any redemptive value. It was good, but for the amount of reviews and ratings I expected better. The Crawfish bisque is something I really recommend! The server put a $20 tip on my $45 meal, knowing that I was very upset with the service, and I put nothing on the gratitude line. Totally fraud!  I got the worst service ever, the server ignored me for most of time, my food was late for almost half an hour while sitting there out of the kitchen, even when I wanted to have the check I got nobody came to me. I complained twice but nothing changed, and I put nothing on gratitude when signing my copy, then later my credit card was charged an additional $20.  I wouldn\\'t have noticed this if it was not for a business trip and I had to ask for a copy later to get it reimbursed. The soft shell crab \"BLT\" was good all around. The heaviness of the fried whole crab was nicely paired with fresh lettuce and tomatoes on a light mayo bread. There was some sort of green sauce, but it didn\\'t seem to add much to the dish.  The fries definitely could have been better. They reminded me of McDonald\\'s fries after you leave them in the bag too long - soft and limp. Don\\'t waste your time, you can fine better food in the tourist area if the quarter.  Service and food not worth the time you have to wait for your food. Came here for convenience-sake and it was a disappointment: 1) wait for food was longer than anticipated; 2) gumbo roux tasted like flour- no touch of Creole seasoning whatsoever- I did not finish it. In addition, it was lukewarm3) and kid\\'s meal fries were limp from being saturated in grease.   I was not charged for the gumbo and I requested fresh french fries, which were delivered how they should have been initially. I will add I was given the opportunity to order another soup; but it was a tad late and I was over it.  The brussel sprouts were a winner.   Not sure what happened to the gumbo though (insert sad face). Even though the roux was thicker than what I\\'m accustomed to, it was bland. First night in NOLA to eat good food, and was disappointed.'"

Well, the brussel sprout appetizer did blow my mind because it was fantastic. The entree, though, did not blow my mind. I went simple and got the burger, it wasn't cooked quite the way I ordered it. Additionally, I had removed a tomato slice from my burger because it wasn't quite ripe and I'm not a lover of tomatoes all the time. A waiter walked over and informed me that I could have asked for the burger without the tomato...uh, duh? I have been to restaurants before. I just wasn't hugely impressed. Our waiter was great, though, and super helpful.\", 'Let me start by saying the oysters are wonderful.  The rest of our meal, not so much.  Our second dish was the Pate of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Livers.  Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.  Our total bill, with a $40 bottle of wine and two cocktails was over $170.  Poor value for inconsistent food.\\nPlease note that our server, Chi, was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.', 'Pretty good food, on the French bistro side of things. Went for dinner, packed on a Monday night. We were seated all the way in the back with a view of the kitchen\\n\\nThe choucroute plate was great, with a huge but tender smoked pork shank, boudin, squares of crispy/melty pork belly, and house made sauerkraut all nestled in a cast iron serving pan. GF had the special, fried pork loin with grits and greens that was tasty but pretty ordinary. Took a WHILE for entrees to arrive, but we left stuffed.', \"Group of hostesses were not welcoming when we walked In at 8:25pm, we didn't have reservations,  told us we wouldn't be able to sit until 945, I then went on open table and booked one for 8:30pm, oh isnt technology amazing! We were sat at 8:35, the group of 4 women at the front just seemed to want to  be bitchy because we didn't make reservations ahead of time, but the website clearly says walk in welcome. The waiter was nice, I had the luke burger and it was average, the bottom bun was soggy from the grease... fries were cold. However my wife had the shrimp and grits and said it was the best she has ever had.\", \"Being a local, I have to give Luke 3 stars... Ok 3 & 1/2 if I could. I love the atmosphere and the food is pretty good, but I wouldn't ever go out of my way to eat here. I've been several times with high hopes since I'm a Besh fan but haven't ever really been impressed. \\n\\nI think there are better places in the city where you can get similar food. It's one of the better places in the CBD I suppose, but not city-wide. \\n\\nTo sum it up, food is good but not amazing. And they do have a great happy hour!\", 'I came here for dinner. The service was okay, she hardly came around to our table. \\n\\nBeet salads (3/5) - The dressing was delicious with the pecan caramel.

I heard their lunch/brunch menu is much better so I would come back to try their brunch.', \"I came here tonight with my cousin and best friend, hoping for a great time. We were out celebrating a birthday!\\n\\nFirst of all, the service was HORRIBLE. I don't know if it was because they undermined us because we looked young, but it seems as if every table was getting attention BUT us. Not only that, but we sat next to a couple that WOULD NOT STOP ARGUING. Definitely ruined the experience of an upscale dinner. \\n\\nSecond, the food was mediocre. We ordered the shrimp and grits, rotisserie chicken, and ribeye. Everything was overly salted and poorly portioned.  Definitely had higher expectations due to the chef's name attached.  \\n\\nWe will NOT be coming back ever. We could totally receive more for what we spent elsewhere. It was definitely an experience. Pictures are posted. It looked better than it tasted.\", 'The atmosphere and the restaurant itself was great, but the food was average at best. I had the burger, which I heard was one of the best, and I didn\\'t think it was that special. I have had \"many\" burgers that were tastier than this one.

Service was average. \\n\\nOut of all the places to eat in NOLA, there are better options elsewhere.', \"There are too many great places to eat in New Orleans for LUKE to deliver such uninspired food and inattentive service. It was the only disappointment we had on a great food weekend. Cochon, Butcher and Herbsaint are all nearby and so much better. Luke's only saving grace was the raw bar but even that took way too long to get a platter of oysters out of. The Burger is also good and a safe choice.\", 'Not a fan, but I am rather picky. I enjoyed the catfish and the cheese grits are amazing. Interesting atmosphere but extremely noisy.', \"Am in on a quick business trip in New Orleans and checked out this place - mainly because of its proximity to my hotel, but also in part because of the excellent reviews here on Yelp. I ordered a bowl of gumbo and a sazerac, both of which were good but not transcendent. The gumbo, at $10 a bowl, was fairly priced but not what I expected in terms of quality. Probably not the house specialty and probably not what I should have ordred, but c'est la vie. \\n\\nEverything seemed a little dusty, as well.

Ordered the shrimp n grits and crab bisque.  Very heavy on the salt.. Overwhelmed the delicate shrimp and crab flavor..  Ordered the Baked oyster .. It had a nice herb flavored in the crust but was over powered by the concentration of butter ..  Yeah, its New Orleans, yeah the food is supposed to be rich and decadent...  But our plates were a bit much..', \"We came for the oyster happy hour and enjoyed the drinks, but were largely disappointed by the oysters. They were all very dirty and 2 of the 12 raw oysters we received looked like they had been mashed up or chewed and returned to the shell. I'd say they were not worth it even at the happy hour price, but I certainly would not pay full price for this. There are much better oysters in the city (and better oyster happy hours!).\", \"As I sit here at the bar desperately trying to get my waitress attention  I can't help but think back to a time when Luke had really great service. I love this restaurant. The food never disappoints . I have been here countless times.  But the service is to be desired. Ive had cocky waitress's, who love to talk over you when asking a question to next to little attention at times at the bar. And no not during happy hour either. Mr. Besh you need to spend some time there.\", \"Happy hour review only. I had a sazarac at pretty much every bar I went to in NOLA, and this one, while very good, doesn't rank anywhere close to the top. However, the price was absolutely unbeatable...I didn't think it was possible to get a sazarac for under $5!  We also split a dozen of the happy hour oysters, and really, all I can say is that they were worth the $.50 each. I've had better oysters in DC, and way better oysters in New Orleans. I'm guessing the non-happy hour ones were higher quality, and I think next time I'd pay a bit more money to get better ones. Ultimately, everything we had was pretty good, but with so many excellent restaurants nearby, I'm not sure I'd make it back.\", \"We dined at Luke for Christmas dinner 2016.  This is a busy, hectic restaurant and does not bode well for a relaxing atmosphere.  In addition, the layout is a long galley so the servers are carefully navigating the space to not bump into each other or customers.  The lighting was bright, not what we were expecting.  We spoke with the manager that night, a woman named Tea who was really great and you could tell that she was the glue keeping the operation together.  Food was good, but I wasn't blown away.  It's tough to stand out in a city with so many great options.\", \"I give this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars. The service was great. Had some locals that worked there tell us what was good on the menu. I got the shrimp and grits which was delicious but it wasn't enough. The fresh baked bread was good too! We also got gumbo for an appetizer and I bit into something very hard which made me stop eating because I didn't want to lose a tooth. The bread pudding was not good but I was able to return it for the cake with blueberry sauce which was very good. My boyfriend got the stuffed shrimp and peach cobbler. The shrimp  was good but the peach cobbler was not the best I ever had. Overall this was a nice place with great service unwound go again to try something else on the menu.\", \"We went here for brunch before the parades while visiting New Orleans Feb. 2014. We didn't have a reservation, but they did seat us. It is loud and was very cold. My husband decided to order the hamburger. It was a $16 hamburger, so he thought it should be spectacular. He said it was just okay. I decided on the steak. I ordered it medium. First time they brought it out, it could moo. I asked to have it recooked. When it was brought back, it was tough and flavorless. I have to say the fries were great and the weight staff was wonderful. But I would definitely not go back there.\", \"We tried Luke for dinner since we'd heard good things. My friends ordered the burger and the shrimp & grits. The burger was pretty good -- it was similar to fathers office in LA but the bun wasn't as crunchy/crispy and it didn't have blue cheese. The portions are huge! The shrimp were super juicy and the steak was also quite tasty but came out a bit rarer than I asked for. \\n\\nOur waiter was awesome -  very personable and friendly. I want to give this place 3.5 stars, because although the food was good, it wasn't a wonder to behold, which is what I had been expecting after all the hype.\", 'Lüke will only receive a three star this time. Although the restaurant look very nice the service was just okay. The hostess was not very friendly. The bartenders were not very friendly when ordering a glass of wine for my girlfriend. Our waiter was actually pretty nice, he did say sorry a lot. Now about the food. For appetizer we ordered was the rabbit- liver pâté which was actually very good. The steak was okay. Nothing to write home about. The crab bisque was fantastic.   There now you know.', \"they love salt in New Orleans.  another restaurant where the flavor was good but overly salty.  plus a place like this should have fresh fries but ours came out cold soggy.  so tried the famous shrimp and grits, rich heavy sauce, nice sausage but too salty.  also shared the seafood platter medium which had a nice assortment of crabs (2 types), clam, oysters (weren't sandy), mussels.\", \"Don't put too much heart into this review, as I only had a soup and salad, but....\\n\\nTable bread was stale, Matzo Ball in my soup was ice cold in the center...The bacon in my salad had a delicious smoke flavor, but was waaaaaay over salted. \\n\\nIm giving 2 stars for cleanliness and nice attentive and friendly staff.\\nNo need to go by and try more things. I'll just hit up Cochon next time I'm in town.\", \"Good food at a price. Went here with our daughter and had great drinks.  The sazerac cocktails were excellent as were the Brussel sprouts. The shrimp etouffee and hamburger were good but not screaming great. Service was professional but not the normal NOLA friendly. Overall I would go back but there are better less expensive restaurants in NOLA with warmer service (Elizabeth's and Jacques-Imo's).\", 'Menu looked interesting so decided to go for lunch. Service prompt and friendly. Ordered seafood gumbo, was excellent. Also had fried oyster salad. Oysters over fried, hard and crunchy with too many chunks of smoked bacon in the salad. Person next to me also had ordered the same salad, oysters were not over fried. Portion size good.', \"Oysters are good especially if you're there during happy hour ($0.75 a pop). Burger was not great ($16.50), cold bun which was too large for the patty and iceberg lettuce. \\n\\nJalapeno grits were good but definitely share as it is quite rich. Shrimp chowder was delicious.\\n\\nOur server personally was pretty rude. Other staff were very polite but I suppose everyone has their good days and bad days.\", \"this was a good last minute brunch find for us. we miscalculated timing of when we needed to leave for the airport given saints traffic, so we bailed on our reservation and headed around the corner to Luke's. \\n\\nServer was very nice and the brunch menu had several appealing options. i enjoyed my shrimp and grits though could have used a larger portion (maybe it was just bc we had eaten nonstop during our trip and my appetite was extra big). i ordered a glass of prosecco that was just ok and my friends both said their bloody mary was just ok as well. \\n\\noverall was a good, quick brunch stop near our hotel before leaving town.\", 'While I realize the importance of seating people with reservations first, why is it such a fuss to get a table when so many are vacant--both at lunch and dinner? I had the buillabaisse and the gumbo. Both were rich in consistently if under-spiced. I also find seafood in New Orleans -/ certainly here -- to taste a bit muddy. Is it fresh? The fresh bread is warm and crispy, served with whipped butter and replenished as needed. The caramel pecan bread pudding was incredible. Service was quite attentive. A very nice Bordeaux was only $44. Again, front desk is a bit off: I wanted to get a burger and sit at the bar and it seemed a big production to determine that only a very small and awkward side spot was available.', \"Okay let's just say it was an odd menu.  But maybe not for New Orleans.  Prices are extreme.  A $19 burger?  It was good but it was still a burger.  My husband had a $15 BLT.  It had 2 small whole fried crabs in it.   My diet coke was a laugh.  They must have had to really search to find bottles that small.  an 8 oz bottle, Just got off a cruise and really wanted a soda.  Okay so maybe I was just out of my comfort zone with this place but not impressed.  A big fat zero on service as well had to wait about 40 minutes for our food.  Waitress was sweet but it was just to long a wait.\", \"This place is good/decent. Before visiting New Orleans, I contacted a few friends for food recommendations and this place came up a couple of times. I would say it was good, but it didn't meet my expectations. The waiter highly recommended the shrimp and grits, but it wasn't great. I had other shrimp and grits at other restaurants over the course of the weekend that were much better and more flavorful. The gnocchi appetizer was very good, and probably the highlight of the meal. My sister got the crispy rice duck confit plate, which was also okay but not great. If I was a local, I would probably go here again but if I was just visiting and in town for only a few days I would go to other places first. The service was very good.\", 'The food was excellent, but my only complaint was the service. I feel like we were shuffled among three different waiters and neither of were communicating with each other. We ended up with three servings of bread rolls and one set of utensils because each waiter kept thinking the other was going to bring a spoon. As I said, other than the service, the food was great. I had the chicken, and it was a nice apportion and tasty.', \"I was really excited to try this place after reading all of the stellar reviews. Unfortunately the shrimp tasted like ammonia. The grits were excellent, but that shrimp shouldn't have been served... especially not to people who have lived on the gulf coast their whole lives. My fiancé had the schnitzel, and that was alright. It was weird that it was served with a mountain of fries though. A side of greens would've been a lot better rather than fried food on top of fried food. He did enjoy the mushroom ragu that came with it though. And the pecan bourbon tart was excellent. Oh well.\", \"Found this place on Yelp and was the first place we ate at after we landed in New Orleans. Luckily we made it for their happy hour. We ordered 2 dozens of raw oysters, it was big but wasn't very tasty. I guess we're just used to the oysters from the east coast where you can taste the sweetness in the oysters. Their fried oysters were surprisingly good, and we normally like our oysters raw. The crawfish bisque was also a hit. I normally don't like thick creamy soup, but this was delicious with the bread!\", 'Luke is okay. The food was too fishy for my liking. We ordered the blue crab salad (returned it) gumbo, and jambalaya. \\nThe customer service was really good although we did not know who our sole server was, we had at least 4 people come to our table. \\n\\nThe bread pudding was the bomb!', 'Ambience perfect\\nStaff needs improvement \\nLocation perfect\\nCocktails delicious\\nGerman starter surprisingly good \\nFood ... well this is the kind of place you pay 25 dls for a salad and when you specify no bacon because you have an allergic reaction to it an they bring bacon on it because kitchen forgot or waiter forgot who knows but makes  you think is it worth paying 25 dls for the salad and after you request for a fresh salad because you think they will do a fresh salad with no bacon and they only remove the bacon and you find a piece of bacon  again !! ... is it worth paying 25 dls for this salad?  No!! \\nI loved the place but imagine they missed this huge detail and I will end up in a the hospital not worth it !!', \"I really want to like this place more than I do. The host staff could be nicer but I get the impression that they're so busy they don't really care if they're welcoming or not. I've had better experiences during lunch in general then happy hour or dinner. The bar area is not separated by much from the dining area and so if you're seated at the bar you tend to get jostled a lot from behind when it's full. That's a real turn off for me. Food's tasty, staff a little cold in general. Oysters are a good happy hour deal by local standards and excellent when compared to Florida and other cities. The bisque is one of the best I've ever had. The beer is definitely worth a try, if you're interested.\", 'Had the crawfish bisque: a little grainy, but good. The burger: really good, but the default prep is with bacon so if that\\'s not your thing you gotta tell them. The bread pudding: nice, but a little TOO sweet. Also had their house-brewed lager which was very good, but a little \"fizzy\" for my taste. \\n\\nAs others have noted, service was a little slow on a Thursday at 7:30pm. Flipside to that: waitstaff won\\'t bug you too much.\\n\\nPrice was just right too. If I get a chance while here in town, I\\'ll make a return trip.', \"If I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would. We visited this place on a whim for brunch and were not disappointed. The food is good and this seems like it would be a pretty classy place for dinner or happy hour. My only complaint is how pricey it is and maybe I just don't fit the lifestyle this place is catering for. I really enjoyed the food and while we sat at the bar, the bartender was very attentive.\", 'Overall had a good experience.  Being a top chef fanatic it was nice to hit a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant\\nWe walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night.  Initially told there were no tables for 1-2 hours. Then while discussing where else we were going to go... poof!  They magically found a table.  That was nice\\n\\nI had had a big lunch so didn\\'t order an appetizer (rare for me!)\\nFor my entree i had the fish of the day meuniere style. with roasted veggies and spaetzle.  It was satisfying.  Felt like i could get something similar at a million NY restaurants though.  Nothing particularly N\\'awlins about it.\\n\\nMy mother had the roast chicken with veggies and french fries.  The juices from the chicken were soo tasty i kept dipping fries in it.  I guess i liked her dish better than mine!\\n\\nA solid meal...', \"The service was brusque and by far the least friendly of the places we ate at, but the happy hour was still pretty good - the fried oysters were our favorite, hot out of the fryer and crispy and the oysters pretty plump at $1.25 per. The raw were also good, and at only 75 cents, a bargoon. The cocktails were strong and also good - the blackberry smash was my favorite, a bourbon based drink, and the ponchat cooler. \\n\\nPretty popular place for HH so I think people fill it up near 3, and then there's a lull by 4:30 or so as the first wave stumbles back (to the office?).\", \"We ate dinner here on Wednesday night.  We started with the crabmeat au gratin and Brussel sprouts - both of which were very good.  To be honest, I am not a fan of Brussel sprouts but our friend was and I tried her's.  They were so good I would order them on my own next time.  My spouse and I each got the Luke burger and fries.  Our friend got the chicken.  They were ok, not good not bad just ok.  For desert we shared the bread pudding and cheesecake.  The bread pudding was outstanding and the cheesecake was good.  The restaurant got more and more throughout the evening.  By the end it was so hard to hear each other we just stopped talking.  The food was pretty good but the noise level was so high it was hard to really enjoy yourself.\", \"They have a happy hour where oysters are special price.  I went with high expectations but it was just okay.  My food wasn't seasoned enough and lot of it tasted bland.  The fish was not crispy.  Too bad because it could've been really good.  Wish they salted the water more when the potatoes were boiled because no matter how much salt I put on them, they didn't stick and it just wasn't the same.  It was super busy as usual and I waited a long time to get my water refilled.  It was my last meal in NOLA and I almost wished I had gone to Cuchon Butcher :(\", \"Not impressed with this restaurant compared to Emeril's for the prices and John Besh was here himself, on Saturday night. But instead of walking around and making sure things were/should have been going well with his diners, he was having diner himself with three other people. Casual setting. My husband said it wasn't the best shrimp and grits as others have said. The crab appetizer was really good and my steak was great. The stuffed oysters were okay but didn't compare to Drago's. Rosemary potatoes were nice and crispy but too much Rosemary in them in my opinion.\", 'Good food but great service! Seated in the back upstairs corner table, managers checked in often. By Linh was the best server on the planet!!', 'ate here for my birthday  with my family which included my 3 year old niece and 5 year old nephew. we wanted some place affordable but nice. the place was affordable yes nice not really. for a place that has an expensive frutti di mare on the menu. i would have expected it to look more upscale like his other restaurants.\\n\\n i had the famous burger my sis had the shrimp and grits and my niece and nephew chicken tenders. my burger was good but not the best ive had. my sis shrimp was good but the grits were too dense for my taste.\\n\\ni may be back perhaps for brunch.', \"Happy Hour Oysters!! 75 cents!\\n\\nCame for oyster happy hour with a friend while in New Orleans. Saw the great reviews figured I'd give it a shot while in the central business district. \\n\\nNice space, friendly servers and quick service. \\n\\nThe oysters were probably slightly above average. They seemed fresh however they were really quite sandy, which was disappointing. The sand kept us from ordering more than our original 2 dozen. \\n\\nThe oyster are gulf oysters which are huge compared to Washington or east coast oyster, so be prepared to order less than you expect. Since they were so large we filled up quite quickly on just 2 dozen for a happy hour snack.\", 'I would have given this place a better rating but the custom service is lackluster.  The food is pretty good but the servers are rude. On the brighter side, at least the hostess was nice. Do not visit this establishment unless you are not particularly interested in good service.', \"I usually don't write reviews and especially negative ones FYI. That said food and drinks prices are a little but on the ridiculous side. We know chef had been on TV but that shouldn't mean you gouge your guests. Crab entrees were nothing special and shrimp and grits w poached was very good so I can recommend but still tough to justify price. Especially with all the amazing shrimp and grits choices within blocks of there. \\n\\nServer was very good, hostess was wiping her runny nose on her sleeve which was not appetizing. \\n\\nIf have to have a meal at one of J Besh restaurants go to August for 3 course meal at lunch instead.

Even if ur seated, if u dont put in the order before happy hour ends you dont get the happy hour price....and im talkin even a seconds/minute off...the waitress tried to put it in and it was too late so had to pay full price.', \"My friend went here for the oysters. They used to be $0.50 during happy hour, but I guess that was awhile back. Now it's $0.75. They weren't really big either. But then again, if you're coming during happy hour, they won't serve the better choices since it would be gone fast. We were here mainly for oysters, but my friend did order a side of fries. They were pretty good. Nothing too too special. They were thin and warm when it came out to us. There was also the complimentary bread that came out. I am unsure why there was no plate provided with it as it just sat causally on the tabletop. Lol. \\n\\nThe service was attentive. The restaurant's atmosphere was one of a dimly lit bar scene. I guess this place is good for drinks and oysters during happy hour.\", \"Brunch was very nice. Our server was attentive. But the meal started off rocky when we waited forever for our soup & and it ended up coming out with the meal. The portion size of my shrimp and grits was a bit smaller than I expected for the price, but it did not lack in taste. I was very excited to try the bread pudding because of yelp reviews & pictures, but it was a tad underwhelming. It was very dense. The crawfish bisque was yummy and mimosas were on the house! It was an experience I can check off my list, but I can't say I would return.\", \"Not my best New Orleans dinner experience.  Service was slow on a Tuesday night when they were no where near full.\\n\\nThe bread they bring to each table is meh.  Opening corn and crab chowder was very good.  I ordered the Tuesday special, a trio of pork.  I expected the pork belly to be fatty, it always is, but the slices of pork were mostly fat, and the fried pork neck was bland.  Overall, the dish had about 7-8 bites of pork meat. I was still hungry.\\n\\nThe fries were good.\\n\\nPS. I forgot when I first wrote this. My dinner came with bread pudding for desert. Best. Ever.  Crusty on top with lots pecans, soft and delicious in the center.\\n\\ni won't be beating down the door to go back.\", \"Luke was overall pretty good. I would say 3.5 stars. The crawfish bisque was good, it had a good flavor, lots of crawfish, and smooth consistency, but I've had better. The blue crab and shrimp étouffée was very good, but very small, like really small, portion for an entree. The shrimp and grits was also very good, but small. There could have been more grits and it would have been more satisfying. The bread pudding was the best I've had at a restaurant. The sauce was great and it came with vanilla bean ice cream on top! Best part of the meal! If the portions were bigger, I would def give Luke 4-4.5 stars!\", \"The service was excellent but the food so-so. My mussels were big, juicy, fresh. But the sauce was bland, a sort of creamy thing with no real notes of garlic, butter, pepper or wine. Bleh. But I ate because I like mussels. The pork shank was huge and filling but not terribly smokey. The crème brûlée was awful. The sugar was fired well ahead of time and the crème itself was very blah--a tasteless custard that was not set correctly. The place is loud on weekends so not for a cozy dinner. On the up side, the service was great and the oysters superb. I'd give it another go just to see.\", 'Ended up choosing Luke after a few trips to New Orleans.

So to be fair nothing was horrible or anything like that but at this price point I think it's ok to expect a little more. 5 minutes after we got our appetizers were delivered they showed up with the entrées and you either have to send your food back to sit under heat lamps or inhale your apps- they whole experience was like that - extremely rushed and not really what one would expect.

Ambience was good, up-scale without being stuffy.  I split the smoked pork shank with my girlfriend who's on the Paleo diet (urgh, don't ask), and it was a bit dry, in my opinion.  The sauerkraut underneath was delish though.  The bread pudding dessert was rich and satisfying.  Coffee: sooo good.

Not sure if that was unintended or clever joke. But needless to say we won\\'t be going back here again. Plenty of other places to try, so it\\'s hard to give a place a second chance.', \"Having read the rave reviews for Luke, we couldn't NOT try it out for ourselves. The food and service were good but we were disappointed that they were out of all draft beers and, a bigger sin, out of foie gras. The dish that was recommended instead (rabbit liver pate) was okay but much too rich to finish even half of it. The moules frites were excellent and the portion generous. Front of house was a touch indifferent and lacking in Southern hospitality. All in all, would still strongly recommend but perhaps check ahead of time for availability of dishes you absolutely want to enjoy.\", \"I bookmarked this place from my last visit to Nola. I was super excited to try this place! Upon arriving  the atmosphere was better than I expected (upscale). \\nMe and my husband ordered the chicken biscuit which is a larger plate so we decided to share. The presentation was excellent the chicken was tender, juicy, & flavorful. I also order a mimosa it wasn't the best I've had I asked to have it returned and order another drink. \\nUpon eating half way through my meal my chicken wasn't done all the way. Instead of sending it back and getting my ordered comped I paid for everything. \\n\\nHonestly I don't know if I'll try them again\", \"I attended last night's Sunday Supper at Luke's.  It was really rather fun sitting with a bunch of strangers and sharing food and conversation.  I enjoyed the overall experience.  Three of the four courses were great but the coq au vin was one tough, dry bird-even with the yummy sauce.  It was authentically made with rooster, but I thought if you slow cook something long enough it would eventually become tender.  That didin't happen.  On the other hand, the oysters, baked and raw, the king crab legs thermador, the butternut squash with shrimp bisque, and the baba au rhum were all great, even if the shrimp in the bisque were a bit salty.  If only they'd been able to pull off the main course, this would have been a five star review.\", 'All the food was excellent and prepared well.  Pricey to be sure (5 crawfish beignets with 1 tiny crawfish each for $15?), but very tasty.\\n\\nThe service was lousy with our disinterested waiter really putting a damper on the meal. The meal was saved when another waiter noticed, swooped in, and started taking care of us.  His name was Steve or Rich... great guy from Chicago.\\n\\nAt any easy $100 before tip for 2 people with 2 drinks, appetizers and entrees, I am not sure I can give a glowing recommendation.   It feels a little greedy for a small bistro with a very limited menu, but it was a very tasty meal.', \"Saw chef John Besh being interviewed on network TV, so I decided to come to Luke to find out what the hype was.  \\n\\nBeautiful restaurant in an old school look.  Excellent service.  I had the shrimp cavatelli etouffee with extra fried shrimp on top.  The cavatelli with cheese was ok, didn't need the extra shrimp which didn't add anything to the dish.  The bread pudding was excellent.  \\n\\nShould have ordered the gumbo.\", \"this review is only for happy hour drinks and oysters:\\nthe oysters weren't as clean,fresh and big as the oysters across the street (Trenasse) and there was very limited drinks on the happy hour menu. There were still pieces of shell on the oysters and they smelled very fishy. The fried oysters were even worse; they were very hard to chew. if you're looking for a good happy hour joint, save yourself a hassle and go across the street to Trenasse (they have much bigger, fresher, cleaner, variety of oysters). \\nThis place is overrated!\", 'My girlfriend and I came here for lunch one Saturday afternoon and we split a dozen raw oysters and the Cochon de Lait sandwich, washed down with peach mimosas. It was all very good, but it wasn\\'t happy hour! \\n\\nUnfortunately, we only learned about the happy hour after our meal and since we were only visiting New Orleans for a few days, its we couldn\\'t just give another go at it. As much as we enjoyed our food, we couldn\\'t help but feel like we could have enjoyed it a lot more during happy hour. Whenever I mention to anybody that we went to Luke in New Orleans, people ask, \"Did you get the happy hour?\" and I can only sullenly lower my head and utter, \"no...\".\\n\\nWithout the happy hour, it just feels utterly ordinary.', \"The food is all right, nothing special.  The service is horrendous.  They treat you like your presence is a total inconvenience to them.  We even saw the bartender roll his eyes at us.  Sorry I bothered you Mr. Fantastic, but I'm a paying customer and my money is as good as the lady in the Prada shoes, so treat me with a little respect.  Anyway, that's all I have to say about this place.\", 'I work nearby and got takeout breakfast here one morning. The food was out quick and very nicely packaged w a separate closed container for my grits. The grits themselves were creamy but the flavor was not for me. The chicken biscuit would have been absolutely delicious, had the actual biscuit not been hard as a rock. The people that work there are nice. I will give this place another try when I can dine in.', 'We had a reservation for three at 730 and arrived around 715.  We were seated at 725 and greater promptly by our server.  We received our drinks and the server answered all of our questions.\\n\\nThe gumbo was full of shrimp oysters and okra, very tasty with great consistency.\\nThe baked oysters were just \"fair\", cooked only half through.  \\n\\nTwo of us ordered the Luke burger and one had the crab legs.  The burger was huge and has a great flavor brought out by the caramelized onions and bacon.  The fries were decent but a bit over cooked.  The crab legs presented nicely and were full and delicious.\\n\\nAll in all a great experience and would go back again when in NOLA!', \"This place is insanely overrated.  I guess it's good if you're staying at the hotel and it has a super convenient location but otherwise I would avoid it.  The food isn't bad but one of its best qualities is that it won't make you sick.  I'll pass next time I'm in New Orleans and recommend you do the same.\", \"This place was huge disappointment. It's pricey and the food is mediocre with capital 'm'. I had a tasty crab bisque which had a heavy taste of old bay. It was serviceable salty and spicy. Not terrible. My friend had the shrimp and grits. Shrimp really over cooked as if it had been sitting around for a while. An expensive cocktail that was very sweet. I had salad with fried oysters, avocado, and bacon. Oysters were fine, hardly any avocado, and totally generic salad. This would all be fine but the food is truly expensive. A thousand better values in New Orleans than this place.\", 'Great oyster happy hour. Some entrees are \"German\" inspired...  more like New Orleans food wearing a lederhosen.. Great apps though, hence the three stars.', 'An ok-experience, nothing to be missed.. We ordered-\\nChicken n waffles- meh, the meat was ok, waffles were soggy and extremely sweet. not worth the price at all.\\nShrimp n grits dish - pretty good\\nCoffee - meh\\nBest part was they accommodated couple of vegetarians in our party.. The server was very attentive and checked with the kitchen for options.. N everybody ended up with a decent breakfast.. Portions are small though.. You need a reservation .. service is pretty slow, even the coffee refills took forever.', 'Great expectations but didn\\'t live up to it. I asked the waiter \"How do the soft-shell crabs look today?\" \"Excellent!\" was his reply. Well, that was the skinniest softshell crab I have ever seen, and it was undercooked to boot. The dish, softshell crab with poached eggs over grits topped with a hollandaise sauce sounded too decadent. And it was. The softshell should have made this dish over the top. Instead, the itsy bitsy, skinny, undercooked crab ruined it. How disappointing that I was led astray by the waiter. In all fairness, the kitchen was slammed, although they were aware of the crowd size as all had reservations. Others at my table got the crabmeat and asparagus omlet and was very pleased. Shrimp and grits tasty but small portion. Overall interesting place but will be a long time before I return, if ever.', \"The prices make Besh's food more accessable.  The service is ok and the food, well it was good.  Normally I would expect more but given the price it is a good value.  Next time I'm going for happy hour and the raw bar instead of lunch.\", \"I did not realize it was part of the hotel but that didn't matter.  The atmosphere, at least in the front of the restaurant, was very authentic with tin ceiling, white tablecloths and comfortable chairs.  The oysters were fresh and wonderful - not briny, buttery,and large.  The brussel sprouts were to die for with a spicy vinaigrette, almonds and apple and as a bonus, they provided the recipe.  Crab and corn bisque was rich and very tasty. On the downside, our server was totally indifferent. Rushed us and when we could not decide on our main, she abruptly left us with the feeling we were not using her time wisely and then gave us cursory attention.  If you don't mind that service, the food is worth it.  I would not return however.\", 'Looked over the menu and asked the waitress for suggestions. I was torn between a couple of options which is always good. I thought I should behave and leave room for later so I found an absolutely amazing healthy option!! Had the fritata with onions and peppers and it also has duck sausage with arugula and vinegrette with chuncks of feta cheese and pesto, tomatoes, and avocado. Comes with wheat toasts. It was pretty big so I was able to finish about 3/4 of it. I would have taken the rest home if I lived nearby. Overall good service and food came out pretty quickly. Went early in the morning to get a seat. Staff wear white coats so you know its fancy. From the pictures, they serve a lot of oysters here but I did not get any whiff of fish smell which pleases me.', \"The setting and the servers are really nice. We really enjoyed our soups as starters although they were tiny. But the beet salad I had was soggy with dressing and they put the cheese on the bottom of the bowl on purpose (because it was so strange I asked). I didn't realize that when we paid $13 for crab meat it was going to be lathered in cream. My boyfriend found a long dark hair in his food halfway through his burger. The manager came over and apologized, still left the burger on the table as if he was still going to eat it. She proceeded to bring out a free dessert that we neither asked for, nor really wanted. When the bill came they had very graciously taken off the $7 coffee cup sized, little bowl of soup. Would never go back. It was ludicrously overpriced.\", 'So, we were told there was a two hour wait, stepped outside, made an Open Table reservation and where then immediately seated. Had fun waltzing back in to the same woman, looking her in the eye and saying. \"We have a reservation\". \\n\\nThe highlights were happy hour 75 cent oysters and half price wine along with great service from Maddie and Kenny. The pate was great and generous. \\n\\nLowlights. Crab and tuna appetizers were great, but tiny portions for $15. Did not order any entrees because I\\'m not a tourist and won\\'t pay $28 for a soft shell crab sandwich or boiled shrimp. Spent nearly $100 and left hungry.', 'I am torn on this review as the food is awesome both at this location as well as the San Antonio, TX location and i think Besh is great.  \\n\\nThe issue I have is that the server was a complete asshat.  I am a very positive person and will rarely call someone out on the Internet (in person where they have a chance to defend their self is more my style). this was rude to my mother and cut her off mid order then proceeded to act like a prick to my sister-in-law.\\n\\nI will most likely visit other locations or other Besh restaurants instead of  this one in the future.', \"I ordered the Étouffee of blue crab & brown shrimp, my friend ordered shrimp and grits. We came when drinks were have off (SCORE!) so ordered a sazerac and riverbend...sazerac was super strong! I thought the food was really solid. The etouffee had so much flavor and the crab was fantastic..really fresh tasting and freshly made pasta. Shrimp and grits was really tasty and had a nice spice to it. I'm taking off a few points for the service which was really bad. By the time we got seated it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order or even acknowledge us even though the servers past us by at least 10 times.\", \"Went here the first night we were in town.  \\nWas not expecting the casual atmosphere, but very much appreciated it as we were so beat from traveling.\\n\\nWe had made a reservation, but it was Monday night and New Orleans seems to be sleeping in the beginning of the week and wakes up as you advance in days.\\n\\nWe loved the Flamenkuche, which was like a flatbread with onions and bacon.  Very tasty.\\n\\nVery much liked the croque madame, cooked crispy and the fries were salty and plentiful.\\n\\nBut in my opinion if you know what a Jewish matzo ball soup tastes like, then you will want to skip onto some other choice on the menu.\\n\\nI'd go back, but it might take awhile to go through all the other restaurants in town.\", \"3 - okay service 4 - food 3 - New Orleans opportunity cost when there is K-Paul's and others that are very New Orleans\\n\\nGreat food fun but too many places that are better. American Sector is a better value and also a Besh restaurant.\", \"Came here for happy hour for half off cocktails (delicious), $1.25 fried oysters (best I've ever had) and less than a dollar for raw oysters! You get the local P and J oysters for the happy hour oysters, which are quite unflavorful and full of oyster shell pieces from shucking. Can't really complain though because for less than a buck a shuck it's still a steal! \\n\\nI would have given perfect star review had it not been for the strand of hair embedded/cooked into our crawfish.... kind of ruined the moment of a superb meal. We couldn't even just pick it off because it was so cooked into the crawfish! Also, no one even came by to ask how our meal was or if we needed anything else, so we never got to show them the hair-wrapped crawfish.\", 'Had crawfish bisque,  gumbo, chicken and biscuit,  and shrimp and grits. \\n\\nIve never been a fan of bisque but theirs was very good. Their gumbo was just as delicious but a little too much okra. But thats where it ends. Chicken and biscuit with honey sauce was overly sweet and greasy. Shrimp and grits were salty. Looked great but failed on taste.', \"+ food was delicious (when we finally got it!) and good drinks and beer. Prices are great during happy hour. \\n\\n- however, the service was pretty bad. orders were forgotten and took more than an hour to get an order of fries (which I had to send back b/c they weren't fried enough!). Good thing they gave us our drinks before they forgot so at least we had something to keep ourselves occupied.\", 'Went to eat from the bar but service was non existent. There was a tender and oyster chucker guy but after getting a glass of wine they were not to be found.  I hung on another 20 min without service and went elsewhere.  They really need better service.\\n\\nBut ... Since im staying at the hilton and its a hundred degrees out I came back a few days later.  Had some coffee and vanilla cake.  Cake was five stars.  But \"fresh\" blueberries were still thawing out.  Service at the bar was a bit better but still slow.', 'During happy hour, this place gets 4 stars.  With $0.50 oysters there really is nothing to complain about.  I have also eaten here twice during non happy hour (once for lunch and once for dinner).  I got the burger one time and the croque madame the other time.  The burger was pretty tasty.  The croque madame was good as well, but both seem overpriced for what they were. The meals come with small condiments which were a nice touch.', 'After all my rave reviews of LUKE I finally had a subpar meal. On a previous Sunday I was here with a friend who ordered the house special veal dish. He was raving about how good it was so I decided to order it myself. I really was disappointed this time as the veal was overcooked and stringy. The gravy did not have the flavor that my friend had previously either. I was very disappointed by this dish.\\n\\nWe also had the happy hour oysters and cocktails which were great. I guess no place can be great everyday.', \"I popped by Luke for the simple reason of hitting them for their HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL - $0.75 oyster, $1.25 fried oysters and half off drinks 3-6pm Everyday.\\n\\nI just wanted a couple of the fried oysters, but was told that they come by the half dozen.  Okay, that's fine.\\n\\nThey arrived in a cute fry basket, and down they went way too easily.\", \"Breakfast was tasty, but it didn't blow me away. Service was great and atmosphere was attractive, upscale and clean. They lost 2 stars due to price. I felt they were priced for convenience of the hotels rather than trying to be competitive with other restaurants. \\n\\nI heard they have a decent happy hour, but after breakfast being so pricey, we didn't go back.\", \"I was seriously disappointed with the quality of food and service at this location. The waiter didn't tell us about the happy hour specials and we had to wait 20-30 minutes for them to pack our left over food and get a check. \\n\\nMy gf tried shrimp with grits which was good but not worth $24. Crab bisque was the main highlight. My burger was alright, nothing to separate it from a Chillis burger and fires were stale. \\n\\nOverall, this is a very pricy place ($$$) with a very mediocre quality food and service. They do have happy hour but they won't tell u about it. I'm not sure why are there so many positive reviews, I think u can do lot better at other places.\", \"Highlights of the menu:\\n\\nThe burger - huge and comes with house made fries\\nCroque monsieur/madame - high end ham& cheese (spring for the egg on top)\\nPate of Rabbit and Duck livers - the flavors complement each other perfectly\\nThe maple sausage served in the Southern breakfast\\nShrimp and Grits - the grits are a revelation (though the portion is small)\\n\\nA great stop for breakfast, lunch or happy hour - I wouldn't waste a coveted dinner spot since there are better Besh spots.\", 'The food was delicious.

Hate corner cutters even if you ply me with delectable oysters.\", 'This place was a tough one for me!  On one hand, the food was fantastic.  The drink/food specials for happy hour was great, but the service, was lackluster.  We sat for some time waiting for water refills, drinks, and the food.  The food that came was wrong, although corrected quickly.  I do have to say, the Brussel Sprouts were some of the best I\\'ve ever eaten.  I may actually dream about them :).

I think my friend liked it more than I did.  The food was good but, with one exception, nothing overly special.  The exception was the P&J oysters which were absolutely fantastic.  If I were to go back, I would make this my meal.  Unfortunately, the shrimp and grits were average and not nearly as good as I have had elsewhere.  And the vanilla cake was really nothing more than a basic pound cake.  The atmosphere is a really cool, which I did not expect as a restaurant located in the first floor of a major chain hotel.

Those were really good but after a while the sauce they have on them started to taste too sweet.  Didn't get to try any of the other food.\", \"My food was good, loved the texture and flavor. The Lüke Salad was a bit too salty. My partner's food was a bit on the blend side, the bratwurst was huge but not very flavorful. The Service was great, the atmosphere was awesome also.\", \"The interior feels like it's part of an old, classic, and fancy hotel. It's small but cozy. The service is nice. There are revolving doors at the entrance but they don't work.\\n\\nThis restaurant focuses solely on food although breakfast is in the category. They don't have anything else beyond coffee and tea, which was fine. \\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken biscuit. It was the most expensive $14 biscuit I ever bought. The fried chicken was entirely tasteless. Maybe that's what the honey was for. However, the meal came with a pile of grits that had a subtle salty taste and grainy texture I enjoyed. The biscuits were baked well. Everything but the chicken was great.\", 'Luke was a pleasant enough place, but not nearly as nice as it believes itself to be.\\n\\nWe visited for lunch on a Saturday, and the food was fine. My steak was a perfect medium, which was odd because I ordered it medium rare. The music was so loud that the waiter misheard us several times. A restaurant pretentious enough to have half of its menu in French should probably have more  discernment than to blast 80s pop at a volume that barely allows for conversation.\\n\\nThe tables were small and crowded, the food overpriced, and the wait staff unskilled. In a city filled with excellent food choices, I definitely will be looking elsewhere for a pleasant meal.', \"Wanted to try the happy hour on the recommendation of friends/locals. The service was somewhat cold and unfriendly. The Happy Hour oysters are a great price but they quite large - not everyone's favorite. Jumbo shrimp were really rubbery and hard to get out of the shell. Sour cocktail, excellent; fries, good; vegetable sides, okay. We didn't particularly like the atmosphere or the service, so we'll be investigating other oyster happy hours.\", \"The happy hour special of 50 cent oysters, which is daily, 3-6PM, is awesome, and that is the best thing about this place.  Oysters were fresh, great flavor, and you can't beat the price.  \\n\\nHowever, the other food we tried there was only OK.  The fries had good flavor, but were super soft which is not my preference for fries.  The Salad Luke was overly dressed so the dressing overpowered any other flavors in the salad.  We also tried the gumbo, which was good, but not fantastic.  \\n\\nI would totally go back for the happy hour and so I will likely try other items on their menu, but I think their oysters is really the only reason to come to this restaurant.\", \"Located within Hilton Hotel, I made a reservation via opentable app. They were busy and people were having a great time. They were a bit too loud after too few many drinks.\\n\\nI asked for a quite table I saw in the back but they didn't want one person to sit there.\\n\\nServer was friendly and fairly prompt.\\n\\nI tried gumbo and oysters for a small dinner. Gumbo wasn't what I remembered as a traditional gumbo. I am not a gumbo expert but it wasn't what I remembered from 10 years ago.\\n\\nI arrived after a happy hour but I heard they have a good happy hour menu here.\", 'I went to Luke with fairly high expectations.  The food was actually very good, but, the atmosphere was far from what I was expecting.  I had heard Luke had a nice Charcuterie dish and it was fantastic.  However, the atmosphere made my wife and I feel like we were eating at a diner .  There were plenty of people at the restaurant, and again, the food was outstanding, it was just all in the presentation of the feel of the restaurant.  I would give the food a 5 star, but, the restaurant only a 3 overall due to the atmosphere of the place.  If you are looking for high end food with a very casual atmosphere, this is the place!', \"Was very excited to try Luke but was disappointed. Was with a group with a set menu with choices which all sounded great. Gumbo which was described as one of the city's best was average at best. Duck w/ crispy rice had all the right flavors but duck was medium well w/o any crispy skin. The bread pudding was all pecans and little bread to contrast. Service was good. Maybe individual dining would be better but in a city that lives for groups you have to get this right.\", 'Restaurant linked to the Hilton on St. Charles.\\nLimited menu item selection. Excellent soups & salads.  \\nHappy Hour 3-6 with reasonable drink selection.  Lunch until 4.\\nVery pricey afterwards.\\nExcellent bar service.  Very good table service.  If female dining solo you may get missed by waiter numerous times while they seem to prefer guests dining with a male & missed for follow ups after receiving your meal, no matter how pleasant you are.\\nAs a solo diner suggest you dine at the bar so you can get served quicker', \"Came here for breakfast and I was very disappointed. I got the chicken as waffles and the chicken was so dry and the waffles were just ehh. I wanted to love this place because I heard so many great things! But I can't even finish it cause It was just okay. The taste of everything was good, just everything felt so dry.\\n\\nThe best thing I had there was probably the french fries. Maybe next time I come back, I'll have a better expereince.\", \"It's a beautiful place with very good services, and it's cross street from our hotel (intercontinental). I picked it to have brunch based on the good reviews and it's so close. It took about 15 minutes to sit at our table with reservation. I saw people just couldn't wait any longer and just left. So if you decide to try it, MAKE RESERVATION. \\nAs for the food, it's okay. I had the shrimp grits (a little salty for my taste) and the rabbit/chicken liver. They are not bad, nothing special either. \\nI did enjoy the clean table cloth and attentive service for a change (since most of the restaurants in New Orleans are situated in old-dirty buildings with minimum service).\\nWhen I was there, everyone around me ordered burger,fries,or po-boy. I would suggest you go else where for more authentic local cuicine.\", \"Had my first mint julep here and I discovered  that I am not a fan. It was too sweet & strong for me. I tried the mussels and fries dish which came with a ton of mussels. They didn't skimp on quantity at all. Since I was visiting from Denver, a landlocked seafood less state, I was ready for any quantity of seafood. I also tried the croque madame (no egg = croque Monsieur) which was ginormous & presented on a cutting board. I tried the seafood gumbo which was really expensive but tasty. The potion could have been larger. Interior of this place is really nice with subway tiles and classic wood panels. The servers wear white coats & were very helpful and attentive. The majority of the patrons were business people. This place is walking distance from the French quarters.\", \"Don't let them sit you in the back room which is SO loud. \\nRestrooms were clean, but smelled like sewage. There were no paper towels in the bathroom and one of the two soap dispensers was empty.\\nFood was just not good. Simple gem salad was drenched in beet juice, it took forever to get our first round of drinks, two people in my party of 12 added crab to their salads and both thought the amount of crab was way too little for the price, two people sent back the shrimp cocktail because it was mushy and tasted funny, flat bread was good, gumbo was good, I won't be back.\", 'My experience mirrors that of Jon from MN. There are just too many outstanding restaurants in NOLA to waste a meal at a mediocre spot. In addition to the fair fare, our server was incredibly lame and he obviously had received zero training. We had to ask repeatedly for water, drinks, place settings and menus. When I asked who in the restaurant knew the wine list best I was initially encouraged when the bartender appeared. That changed quickly when I asked about a Cali red and he plugged it into his phone and proudly told me what town it came from. This was the full extent of his knowledge. Lastly, I tried to give management the opportunity to respond when I shared my email address on the bill in the section where they asked for comments. I wrote, Please email Me.That was three weeks ago. Zip. One and done.', \"John Besh's restaurant is pretty good.  Its just unfortunate for Luke's that I had been eating way too many great meals in New Orleans and this gets lost in the shuffle.  For an appetizer we ate oysters and shrimp.  Both were really good but pretty standard appetizers in New Orleans.  For our main entree I had the jagershnitzel.  eh.  I wouldnt order it again.  The mix drinks werent as good as I had hoped.  Overall, I was really hoping for something better here.  Maybe it was the expectations.  This is really a 2 1/2 stars for me. Maybe the cooks that night were out partying at mardi gras.\", \"Went with my gal pals for happy hour. It's a cool chill place. We enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the locals. Our server was great and very attentive. We stopped for libations and a lite snack but ended up getting coffee, dessert, and a cocktail. The cocktails were a bit strong for our taste but once the ice melted a bit they were good. Will definitely visit again before the end of our trip when we're not in a rush.\", \"Cool looking place and good staff but the food was just okay. I went for lunch so I assume it was a smaller menu option. I got the burger and shared the brussel sprouts and both were presented well but like I said earlier it's was just okay.\", \"I was a bit disappointed!  If someone said, pick one  word to you describe your experience here?  It would be INCONSISTENT.  \\nI ordered the ribeye steak medium well, but it came out to me with portions of the steak well done to medium rare.  My son ordered the chicken tenders and one of the chicken tender was cold.  The raw oysters were delicious and fresh, but some had broken shell pieces in them.  The french fries were unforgettably heavily salted. Didn't expect this at all with the positive reviews I read.\\nThe positive is that my other son did enjoy his cheeseburger and my husband's shrimp and grits were really good!  So maybe it's just a different cook who dealt with theirs?  Who knows!  But if we ever do come back to NOLA, I don't think we'll be back here to eat again.\", \"Well, always a favorite so let's start there. The French 75 is always good and the oysters are always good. The food almost never disappoints. What did tonight was service. Fully staff, or don't open, or don't oversell when you don't have enough staff to cover. We love Luke, don't make us not want to come back.\", \"Great HH from 3-6 where oysters are 50 cents and drinks are half off.\\nThe oysters were a bit sandy, but how can you complain at this price?\\n\\nService was a bit slow and our waiter said it was because the shucking station was backed up.  Understandable.\\n\\nI also had a delicious red beet salad.  Upon arrival, I only saw a bunch of greens only to find layers of the tangy beet underneath.  It was topped with gorgonzola and spicy pecans.  Quite delicious!\\n\\nHusband had the fried oyster bacon salad.  \\nHis advice:  Next time extra bacon and no oyster.  He didn't like the way they were fried.  The cube sized bacon bits were delicious tho!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place for if you're in the mood for some oysters and a drink.  \\n\\nMake sure you try the homemade potato chips while you're there!!\", '12/3/19 - updated review: I went back to Luke due to late work meetings. Well this time is wasn\\'t as great. The service was great but the food was not. I ordered the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" which was amazing the the night before. This day, it was disappointing. The decor on the food wasn\\'t the same. The dish came out cold. The waiter got\\nit reheated but the food didn\\'t come out the same.\\nThe grits were not as cheesy and delicious as the night before. It was watery and not as flavorful.\\nThe highlight was the brusselsprouts. They were flavorful and had a hint of spice to it. Simply delicious! I was very disappointed with the grits, the dish was the only reason I came back. The plating was even different.', \"wow super super super overpriced, this place has nothing special , also their product not even fresh\\norder a blue crab dip, you'll see what i mean \\nabsolutely this place not recommended \\nthere's tons of places out side of downtown please look for them\"]\n"

       "'If I were writing this based on my dinner experience, it\\'d be 4 stars, but we went back for brunch the next day.  Dinner: GREAT happy hour, we had 3 dozen oysters. The place was clean, efficient, and really good. Shawn (female) was on the ball! Pros: Happy hour drink prices. Oysters were divine (I had the P&J) Cons: I ordered the express, which was rabbit sausage with mustard sauce and noodles...mediocre at best.  Breakfast: Service was slow as Hell compared to the night. Everyone around us was getting agitated Pros: Eggs in a jar was so unique I actually took a photo of it. Cons: Menu was tiny, a mimosa special would help this place out. Just ok. This restaurant was attached to our hotel.   Bread pudding was burnt on top and all of the yummy sauce dripped off before it was served.  The \"bacon onion pizza\" (I cant pronounce the actual name, but we felt \"flamin cootchie\" was a possibility)was supposed to be awesome, but I felt the torte was soggy.   The beet salad was great. Shrimp étouffée  had a good sauce, but small portion.   As mentioned in other reviews, expect to spend some time there because the waitstaff is very nice, but slow.  All in all, there are better places to eat in NOLA. This place was ok, it definitely didn\\'t blow my mind. Well, the brussel sprout appetizer did blow my mind because it was fantastic. The entree, though, did not blow my mind. I went simple and got the burger, it wasn\\'t cooked quite the way I ordered it. Additionally, I had removed a tomato slice from my burger because it wasn\\'t quite ripe and I\\'m not a lover of tomatoes all the time. A waiter walked over and informed me that I could have asked for the burger without the tomato...uh, duh? I have been to restaurants before. I just wasn\\'t hugely impressed. Our waiter was great, though, and super helpful. Let me start by saying the oysters are wonderful.  The rest of our meal, not so much.  Our second dish was the Pate of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Livers.  Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.  Our total bill, with a $40 bottle of wine and two cocktails was over $170.  Poor value for inconsistent food. Please note that our server, Chi, was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful. Pretty good food, on the French bistro side of things. Went for dinner, packed on a Monday night. We were seated all the way in the back with a view of the kitchen  The choucroute plate was great, with a huge but tender smoked pork shank, boudin, squares of crispy/melty pork belly, and house made sauerkraut all nestled in a cast iron serving pan. GF had the special, fried pork loin with grits and greens that was tasty but pretty ordinary. Took a WHILE for entrees to arrive, but we left stuffed. Group of hostesses were not welcoming when we walked In at 8:25pm, we didn\\'t have reservations,  told us we wouldn\\'t be able to sit until 945, I then went on open table and booked one for 8:30pm, oh isnt technology amazing! We were sat at 8:35, the group of 4 women at the front just seemed to want to  be bitchy because we didn\\'t make reservations ahead of time, but the website clearly says walk in welcome. The waiter was nice, I had the luke burger and it was average, the bottom bun was soggy from the grease... fries were cold. However my wife had the shrimp and grits and said it was the best she has ever had. Being a local, I have to give Luke 3 stars... Ok 3 & 1/2 if I could. I love the atmosphere and the food is pretty good, but I wouldn\\'t ever go out of my way to eat here. I\\'ve been several times with high hopes since I\\'m a Besh fan but haven\\'t ever really been impressed.   I think there are better places in the city where you can get similar food. It\\'s one of the better places in the CBD I suppose, but not city-wide.   To sum it up, food is good but not amazing. And they do have a great happy hour! I came here for dinner. The service was okay, she hardly came around to our table.   Beet salads (3/5) - The dressing was delicious with the pecan caramel. However, they need to chop those veggies smaller because when I eat the sauce would get all over my face.  Fried oyster salad (3/5) - The best part is the fried oysters Flammenkuchen (1/5) - Cheesy, salty and sweet....I did not like it at all Cream brulee (4/5)  Overall, it was an okay restaurant. I heard their lunch/brunch menu is much better so I would come back to try their brunch. I came here tonight with my cousin and best friend, hoping for a great time. We were out celebrating a birthday!  First of all, the service was HORRIBLE. I don\\'t know if it was because they undermined us because we looked young, but it seems as if every table was getting attention BUT us. Not only that, but we sat next to a couple that WOULD NOT STOP ARGUING. Definitely ruined the experience of an upscale dinner.   Second, the food was mediocre. We ordered the shrimp and grits, rotisserie chicken, and ribeye. Everything was overly salted and poorly portioned.  Definitely had higher expectations due to the chef\\'s name attached.    We will NOT be coming back ever. We could totally receive more for what we spent elsewhere. It was definitely an experience. Pictures are posted. It looked better than it tasted. The atmosphere and the restaurant itself was great, but the food was average at best. I had the burger, which I heard was one of the best, and I didn\\'t think it was that special. I have had \"many\" burgers that were tastier than this one. The fries would have been good, but the ones they served me were nothing but crumbs. My wife had the shrimp and grits and she said they were good. So that was a positive. Service was average.   Out of all the places to eat in NOLA, there are better options elsewhere. There are too many great places to eat in New Orleans for LUKE to deliver such uninspired food and inattentive service. It was the only disappointment we had on a great food weekend. Cochon, Butcher and Herbsaint are all nearby and so much better. Luke\\'s only saving grace was the raw bar but even that took way too long to get a platter of oysters out of. The Burger is also good and a safe choice. Not a fan, but I am rather picky. I enjoyed the catfish and the cheese grits are amazing. Interesting atmosphere but extremely noisy. Am in on a quick business trip in New Orleans and checked out this place - mainly because of its proximity to my hotel, but also in part because of the excellent reviews here on Yelp. I ordered a bowl of gumbo and a sazerac, both of which were good but not transcendent. The gumbo, at $10 a bowl, was fairly priced but not what I expected in terms of quality. Probably not the house specialty and probably not what I should have ordred, but c\\'est la vie.   Everything seemed a little dusty, as well. Just didn\\'t feel all that clean or comfortable.  Would definitely come back, but with a bigger appetite and a wider focus on the menu. Our party of 5 arrived at Luke on a Friday before heading off to Jazzfest. We made a reservation the night before but when we entered the restaurant it too the hostess almost 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing in the lobby. There were 2 other groups waiting there as well.   That beginning wait kind of set the tone for the whole meal. The service was a little slow. The cocktails and food were good. I got the southern breakfast, my friends got the chicken biscuit and shrimp and grits. We all liked our meals.   If you don\\'t mind a wait then stop on into Luke, where the experience is good but I would not go out of the way to stop in here. First meal in NOLA .. Went here cause it was the highest rated place that was open and in walking distance to the hotel.. The Brussels sprouts were awesome.. Definitely get these..  Ordered the shrimp n grits and crab bisque.  Very heavy on the salt.. Overwhelmed the delicate shrimp and crab flavor..  Ordered the Baked oyster .. It had a nice herb flavored in the crust but was over powered by the concentration of butter ..  Yeah, its New Orleans, yeah the food is supposed to be rich and decadent...  But our plates were a bit much.. We came for the oyster happy hour and enjoyed the drinks, but were largely disappointed by the oysters. They were all very dirty and 2 of the 12 raw oysters we received looked like they had been mashed up or chewed and returned to the shell. I\\'d say they were not worth it even at the happy hour price, but I certainly would not pay full price for this. There are much better oysters in the city (and better oyster happy hours!). As I sit here at the bar desperately trying to get my waitress attention  I can\\'t help but think back to a time when Luke had really great service. I love this restaurant. The food never disappoints . I have been here countless times.  But the service is to be desired. Ive had cocky waitress\\'s, who love to talk over you when asking a question to next to little attention at times at the bar. And no not during happy hour either. Mr. Besh you need to spend some time there. Happy hour review only. I had a sazarac at pretty much every bar I went to in NOLA, and this one, while very good, doesn\\'t rank anywhere close to the top. However, the price was absolutely unbeatable...I didn\\'t think it was possible to get a sazarac for under $5!  We also split a dozen of the happy hour oysters, and really, all I can say is that they were worth the $.50 each. I\\'ve had better oysters in DC, and way better oysters in New Orleans. I\\'m guessing the non-happy hour ones were higher quality, and I think next time I\\'d pay a bit more money to get better ones. Ultimately, everything we had was pretty good, but with so many excellent restaurants nearby, I\\'m not sure I\\'d make it back. We dined at Luke for Christmas dinner 2016.  This is a busy, hectic restaurant and does not bode well for a relaxing atmosphere.  In addition, the layout is a long galley so the servers are carefully navigating the space to not bump into each other or customers.  The lighting was bright, not what we were expecting.  We spoke with the manager that night, a woman named Tea who was really great and you could tell that she was the glue keeping the operation together.  Food was good, but I wasn\\'t blown away.  It\\'s tough to stand out in a city with so many great options. I give this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars. The service was great. Had some locals that worked there tell us what was good on the menu. I got the shrimp and grits which was delicious but it wasn\\'t enough. The fresh baked bread was good too! We also got gumbo for an appetizer and I bit into something very hard which made me stop eating because I didn\\'t want to lose a tooth. The bread pudding was not good but I was able to return it for the cake with blueberry sauce which was very good. My boyfriend got the stuffed shrimp and peach cobbler. The shrimp  was good but the peach cobbler was not the best I ever had. Overall this was a nice place with great service unwound go again to try something else on the menu. We went here for brunch before the parades while visiting New Orleans Feb. 2014. We didn\\'t have a reservation, but they did seat us. It is loud and was very cold. My husband decided to order the hamburger. It was a $16 hamburger, so he thought it should be spectacular. He said it was just okay. I decided on the steak. I ordered it medium. First time they brought it out, it could moo. I asked to have it recooked. When it was brought back, it was tough and flavorless. I have to say the fries were great and the weight staff was wonderful. But I would definitely not go back there. We tried Luke for dinner since we\\'d heard good things. My friends ordered the burger and the shrimp & grits. The burger was pretty good -- it was similar to fathers office in LA but the bun wasn\\'t as crunchy/crispy and it didn\\'t have blue cheese. The portions are huge! The shrimp were super juicy and the steak was also quite tasty but came out a bit rarer than I asked for.   Our waiter was awesome -  very personable and friendly. I want to give this place 3.5 stars, because although the food was good, it wasn\\'t a wonder to behold, which is what I had been expecting after all the hype. Lüke will only receive a three star this time. Although the restaurant look very nice the service was just okay. The hostess was not very friendly. The bartenders were not very friendly when ordering a glass of wine for my girlfriend. Our waiter was actually pretty nice, he did say sorry a lot. Now about the food. For appetizer we ordered was the rabbit- liver pâté which was actually very good. The steak was okay. Nothing to write home about. The crab bisque was fantastic.   There now you know. they love salt in New Orleans.  another restaurant where the flavor was good but overly salty.  plus a place like this should have fresh fries but ours came out cold soggy.  so tried the famous shrimp and grits, rich heavy sauce, nice sausage but too salty.  also shared the seafood platter medium which had a nice assortment of crabs (2 types), clam, oysters (weren\\'t sandy), mussels. Don\\'t put too much heart into this review, as I only had a soup and salad, but....  Table bread was stale, Matzo Ball in my soup was ice cold in the center...The bacon in my salad had a delicious smoke flavor, but was waaaaaay over salted.   Im giving 2 stars for cleanliness and nice attentive and friendly staff. No need to go by and try more things. I\\'ll just hit up Cochon next time I\\'m in town. Good food at a price. Went here with our daughter and had great drinks.  The sazerac cocktails were excellent as were the Brussel sprouts. The shrimp etouffee and hamburger were good but not screaming great. Service was professional but not the normal NOLA friendly. Overall I would go back but there are better less expensive restaurants in NOLA with warmer service (Elizabeth\\'s and Jacques-Imo\\'s). Menu looked interesting so decided to go for lunch. Service prompt and friendly. Ordered seafood gumbo, was excellent. Also had fried oyster salad. Oysters over fried, hard and crunchy with too many chunks of smoked bacon in the salad. Person next to me also had ordered the same salad, oysters were not over fried. Portion size good. Oysters are good especially if you\\'re there during happy hour ($0.75 a pop). Burger was not great ($16.50), cold bun which was too large for the patty and iceberg lettuce.   Jalapeno grits were good but definitely share as it is quite rich. Shrimp chowder was delicious.  Our server personally was pretty rude. Other staff were very polite but I suppose everyone has their good days and bad days. this was a good last minute brunch find for us. we miscalculated timing of when we needed to leave for the airport given saints traffic, so we bailed on our reservation and headed around the corner to Luke\\'s.   Server was very nice and the brunch menu had several appealing options. i enjoyed my shrimp and grits though could have used a larger portion (maybe it was just bc we had eaten nonstop during our trip and my appetite was extra big). i ordered a glass of prosecco that was just ok and my friends both said their bloody mary was just ok as well.   overall was a good, quick brunch stop near our hotel before leaving town. While I realize the importance of seating people with reservations first, why is it such a fuss to get a table when so many are vacant--both at lunch and dinner? I had the buillabaisse and the gumbo. Both were rich in consistently if under-spiced. I also find seafood in New Orleans -/ certainly here -- to taste a bit muddy. Is it fresh? The fresh bread is warm and crispy, served with whipped butter and replenished as needed. The caramel pecan bread pudding was incredible. Service was quite attentive. A very nice Bordeaux was only $44. Again, front desk is a bit off: I wanted to get a burger and sit at the bar and it seemed a big production to determine that only a very small and awkward side spot was available. Okay let\\'s just say it was an odd menu.  But maybe not for New Orleans.  Prices are extreme.  A $19 burger?  It was good but it was still a burger.  My husband had a $15 BLT.  It had 2 small whole fried crabs in it.   My diet coke was a laugh.  They must have had to really search to find bottles that small.  an 8 oz bottle, Just got off a cruise and really wanted a soda.  Okay so maybe I was just out of my comfort zone with this place but not impressed.  A big fat zero on service as well had to wait about 40 minutes for our food.  Waitress was sweet but it was just to long a wait. This place is good/decent. Before visiting New Orleans, I contacted a few friends for food recommendations and this place came up a couple of times. I would say it was good, but it didn\\'t meet my expectations. The waiter highly recommended the shrimp and grits, but it wasn\\'t great. I had other shrimp and grits at other restaurants over the course of the weekend that were much better and more flavorful. The gnocchi appetizer was very good, and probably the highlight of the meal. My sister got the crispy rice duck confit plate, which was also okay but not great. If I was a local, I would probably go here again but if I was just visiting and in town for only a few days I would go to other places first. The service was very good. The food was excellent, but my only complaint was the service. I feel like we were shuffled among three different waiters and neither of were communicating with each other. We ended up with three servings of bread rolls and one set of utensils because each waiter kept thinking the other was going to bring a spoon. As I said, other than the service, the food was great. I had the chicken, and it was a nice apportion and tasty. I was really excited to try this place after reading all of the stellar reviews. Unfortunately the shrimp tasted like ammonia. The grits were excellent, but that shrimp shouldn\\'t have been served... especially not to people who have lived on the gulf coast their whole lives. My fiancé had the schnitzel, and that was alright. It was weird that it was served with a mountain of fries though. A side of greens would\\'ve been a lot better rather than fried food on top of fried food. He did enjoy the mushroom ragu that came with it though. And the pecan bourbon tart was excellent. Oh well. Found this place on Yelp and was the first place we ate at after we landed in New Orleans. Luckily we made it for their happy hour. We ordered 2 dozens of raw oysters, it was big but wasn\\'t very tasty. I guess we\\'re just used to the oysters from the east coast where you can taste the sweetness in the oysters. Their fried oysters were surprisingly good, and we normally like our oysters raw. The crawfish bisque was also a hit. I normally don\\'t like thick creamy soup, but this was delicious with the bread! Luke is okay. The food was too fishy for my liking. We ordered the blue crab salad (returned it) gumbo, and jambalaya.  The customer service was really good although we did not know who our sole server was, we had at least 4 people come to our table.   The bread pudding was the bomb! Ambience perfect Staff needs improvement  Location perfect Cocktails delicious German starter surprisingly good  Food ... well this is the kind of place you pay 25 dls for a salad and when you specify no bacon because you have an allergic reaction to it an they bring bacon on it because kitchen forgot or waiter forgot who knows but makes  you think is it worth paying 25 dls for the salad and after you request for a fresh salad because you think they will do a fresh salad with no bacon and they only remove the bacon and you find a piece of bacon  again !! ... is it worth paying 25 dls for this salad?  No!!  I loved the place but imagine they missed this huge detail and I will end up in a the hospital not worth it !! I really want to like this place more than I do. The host staff could be nicer but I get the impression that they\\'re so busy they don\\'t really care if they\\'re welcoming or not. I\\'ve had better experiences during lunch in general then happy hour or dinner. The bar area is not separated by much from the dining area and so if you\\'re seated at the bar you tend to get jostled a lot from behind when it\\'s full. That\\'s a real turn off for me. Food\\'s tasty, staff a little cold in general. Oysters are a good happy hour deal by local standards and excellent when compared to Florida and other cities. The bisque is one of the best I\\'ve ever had. The beer is definitely worth a try, if you\\'re interested. Had the crawfish bisque: a little grainy, but good. The burger: really good, but the default prep is with bacon so if that\\'s not your thing you gotta tell them. The bread pudding: nice, but a little TOO sweet. Also had their house-brewed lager which was very good, but a little \"fizzy\" for my taste.   As others have noted, service was a little slow on a Thursday at 7:30pm. Flipside to that: waitstaff won\\'t bug you too much.  Price was just right too. If I get a chance while here in town, I\\'ll make a return trip. If I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would. We visited this place on a whim for brunch and were not disappointed. The food is good and this seems like it would be a pretty classy place for dinner or happy hour. My only complaint is how pricey it is and maybe I just don\\'t fit the lifestyle this place is catering for. I really enjoyed the food and while we sat at the bar, the bartender was very attentive. Overall had a good experience.  Being a top chef fanatic it was nice to hit a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night.  Initially told there were no tables for 1-2 hours. Then while discussing where else we were going to go... poof!  They magically found a table.  That was nice  I had had a big lunch so didn\\'t order an appetizer (rare for me!) For my entree i had the fish of the day meuniere style. with roasted veggies and spaetzle.  It was satisfying.  Felt like i could get something similar at a million NY restaurants though.  Nothing particularly N\\'awlins about it.  My mother had the roast chicken with veggies and french fries.  The juices from the chicken were soo tasty i kept dipping fries in it.  I guess i liked her dish better than mine!  A solid meal... The service was brusque and by far the least friendly of the places we ate at, but the happy hour was still pretty good - the fried oysters were our favorite, hot out of the fryer and crispy and the oysters pretty plump at $1.25 per. The raw were also good, and at only 75 cents, a bargoon. The cocktails were strong and also good - the blackberry smash was my favorite, a bourbon based drink, and the ponchat cooler.   Pretty popular place for HH so I think people fill it up near 3, and then there\\'s a lull by 4:30 or so as the first wave stumbles back (to the office?). We ate dinner here on Wednesday night.  We started with the crabmeat au gratin and Brussel sprouts - both of which were very good.  To be honest, I am not a fan of Brussel sprouts but our friend was and I tried her\\'s.  They were so good I would order them on my own next time.  My spouse and I each got the Luke burger and fries.  Our friend got the chicken.  They were ok, not good not bad just ok.  For desert we shared the bread pudding and cheesecake.  The bread pudding was outstanding and the cheesecake was good.  The restaurant got more and more throughout the evening.  By the end it was so hard to hear each other we just stopped talking.  The food was pretty good but the noise level was so high it was hard to really enjoy yourself. They have a happy hour where oysters are special price.  I went with high expectations but it was just okay.  My food wasn\\'t seasoned enough and lot of it tasted bland.  The fish was not crispy.  Too bad because it could\\'ve been really good.  Wish they salted the water more when the potatoes were boiled because no matter how much salt I put on them, they didn\\'t stick and it just wasn\\'t the same.  It was super busy as usual and I waited a long time to get my water refilled.  It was my last meal in NOLA and I almost wished I had gone to Cuchon Butcher :( Not impressed with this restaurant compared to Emeril\\'s for the prices and John Besh was here himself, on Saturday night. But instead of walking around and making sure things were/should have been going well with his diners, he was having diner himself with three other people. Casual setting. My husband said it wasn\\'t the best shrimp and grits as others have said. The crab appetizer was really good and my steak was great. The stuffed oysters were okay but didn\\'t compare to Drago\\'s. Rosemary potatoes were nice and crispy but too much Rosemary in them in my opinion. Good food but great service! Seated in the back upstairs corner table, managers checked in often. By Linh was the best server on the planet!! ate here for my birthday  with my family which included my 3 year old niece and 5 year old nephew. we wanted some place affordable but nice. the place was affordable yes nice not really. for a place that has an expensive frutti di mare on the menu. i would have expected it to look more upscale like his other restaurants.   i had the famous burger my sis had the shrimp and grits and my niece and nephew chicken tenders. my burger was good but not the best ive had. my sis shrimp was good but the grits were too dense for my taste.  i may be back perhaps for brunch. Happy Hour Oysters!! 75 cents!  Came for oyster happy hour with a friend while in New Orleans. Saw the great reviews figured I\\'d give it a shot while in the central business district.   Nice space, friendly servers and quick service.   The oysters were probably slightly above average. They seemed fresh however they were really quite sandy, which was disappointing. The sand kept us from ordering more than our original 2 dozen.   The oyster are gulf oysters which are huge compared to Washington or east coast oyster, so be prepared to order less than you expect. Since they were so large we filled up quite quickly on just 2 dozen for a happy hour snack. I would have given this place a better rating but the custom service is lackluster.  The food is pretty good but the servers are rude. On the brighter side, at least the hostess was nice. Do not visit this establishment unless you are not particularly interested in good service. I usually don\\'t write reviews and especially negative ones FYI. That said food and drinks prices are a little but on the ridiculous side. We know chef had been on TV but that shouldn\\'t mean you gouge your guests. Crab entrees were nothing special and shrimp and grits w poached was very good so I can recommend but still tough to justify price. Especially with all the amazing shrimp and grits choices within blocks of there.   Server was very good, hostess was wiping her runny nose on her sleeve which was not appetizing.   If have to have a meal at one of J Besh restaurants go to August for 3 course meal at lunch instead. Enjoy and happy dining in Nola! Oh also skip acme and go to Felix\\'s right across the street. More of a 3.75. Seating is mad crowded. Happy hour prices especially for oysters and drinks are really good. It was bout $.65 per oyster. Without happy hour still not bad at $1.25ish. Definitely anything cheaper you can find in NY or Cali lol.  I didnt get to try anything else. The fried oysters were just ok.  Get there for happy hour on time. Even if ur seated, if u dont put in the order before happy hour ends you dont get the happy hour price....and im talkin even a seconds/minute off...the waitress tried to put it in and it was too late so had to pay full price. My friend went here for the oysters. They used to be $0.50 during happy hour, but I guess that was awhile back. Now it\\'s $0.75. They weren\\'t really big either. But then again, if you\\'re coming during happy hour, they won\\'t serve the better choices since it would be gone fast. We were here mainly for oysters, but my friend did order a side of fries. They were pretty good. Nothing too too special. They were thin and warm when it came out to us. There was also the complimentary bread that came out. I am unsure why there was no plate provided with it as it just sat causally on the tabletop. Lol.   The service was attentive. The restaurant\\'s atmosphere was one of a dimly lit bar scene. I guess this place is good for drinks and oysters during happy hour. Brunch was very nice. Our server was attentive. But the meal started off rocky when we waited forever for our soup & and it ended up coming out with the meal. The portion size of my shrimp and grits was a bit smaller than I expected for the price, but it did not lack in taste. I was very excited to try the bread pudding because of yelp reviews & pictures, but it was a tad underwhelming. It was very dense. The crawfish bisque was yummy and mimosas were on the house! It was an experience I can check off my list, but I can\\'t say I would return. Not my best New Orleans dinner experience.  Service was slow on a Tuesday night when they were no where near full.  The bread they bring to each table is meh.  Opening corn and crab chowder was very good.  I ordered the Tuesday special, a trio of pork.  I expected the pork belly to be fatty, it always is, but the slices of pork were mostly fat, and the fried pork neck was bland.  Overall, the dish had about 7-8 bites of pork meat. I was still hungry.  The fries were good.  PS. I forgot when I first wrote this. My dinner came with bread pudding for desert. Best. Ever.  Crusty on top with lots pecans, soft and delicious in the center.  i won\\'t be beating down the door to go back. Luke was overall pretty good. I would say 3.5 stars. The crawfish bisque was good, it had a good flavor, lots of crawfish, and smooth consistency, but I\\'ve had better. The blue crab and shrimp étouffée was very good, but very small, like really small, portion for an entree. The shrimp and grits was also very good, but small. There could have been more grits and it would have been more satisfying. The bread pudding was the best I\\'ve had at a restaurant. The sauce was great and it came with vanilla bean ice cream on top! Best part of the meal! If the portions were bigger, I would def give Luke 4-4.5 stars! The service was excellent but the food so-so. My mussels were big, juicy, fresh. But the sauce was bland, a sort of creamy thing with no real notes of garlic, butter, pepper or wine. Bleh. But I ate because I like mussels. The pork shank was huge and filling but not terribly smokey. The crème brûlée was awful. The sugar was fired well ahead of time and the crème itself was very blah--a tasteless custard that was not set correctly. The place is loud on weekends so not for a cozy dinner. On the up side, the service was great and the oysters superb. I\\'d give it another go just to see. Ended up choosing Luke after a few trips to New Orleans.  Nice space with nice decor.    Ordered: Crawfish beignets Raw Oysters  Shrimp and grits  Burgers    The oysters were huge!!!!!     Crawfish beignets were average at best.   The sauce was delicious.  Friends enjoyed the burgers and the presentation was nice.  The shrimp and grits were tasty but could have had some more heat.  All in all not a bad choice. Was here on New Years Day in the afternoon and swear I spotted a couple of actresses, though I am hard pressed to find their names. The coffee was delicious, good Bloody Mary\\'s and the service was on point. Get the P&J oysters, you won\\'t be disappointed. I followed it up with the burger. It was good, not outstanding. I could not finish it. My date got the Eggs in Purgatory and those were rich and decadent. She had the jalapeño grits and they were absolutely amazing. We couldn\\'t stop eating them. Forgo the French fries for the grits, you can thank me later. We got there barely in time for the happy hour oysters. $.75. Quite a deal. They were huge! Also got the happy hour drinks good deal. Had the crawfish etoufoille. It tasted a little squid like for me. But that is probably how the dish was supposed to be. My wife got The softshell crab BLT. It was the biggest softshell crab I had ever seen. She ate it all even thiugh she had a huge lunch. It was great. We were excited for dinner on my wife\\'s first trip to NOLA and decided to try this place based on reviews and the menu we saw online. We ordered the pate \"scented with truffles\" there was certainly no truffle flavor but the pate was very good. I had the Etouffee which was good and she had the entrecote with fries which was perfectly cooked but served with a massive portion of butter. Overall the food was good but the service was slow and almost uninterested even though they were two waiters assigned to our table. The service was kind of lack luster and the food was pretty good.  I would definitely recommend the baked PJ/ herbsaint oysters, they were delicious, they had a light breeding on then which consisted of herbs, bread and cheese. They were then lightly baked but not too long... They were still slightly raw. I thought it was delicious, and so didn\\'t the other 3 that were with me.  We also had the hot boudin Louisiana 2which was actually really good too.  The étouffée was good, not amazing.  We also had raw oysters which were very good and lastly, the shrimp and grits... Which was probably the best entree. This place is more casual than I initially expected, but it still has a nice ambience. My friend had the shrimp and grits (which was everyone\\'s favorite) because it was packed with flavor. I had the chicken and it was a little dry for me. We also shared a bottle of wine. The prices were reasonable. A concierge highly recommended this restaurant.  It was solid-good.  I would not say out-of-this world great. I found the gumbo to be fair at best. My shrimp and grits entree was very good. The wine list was good with nice selections by he glass. Service was very good.  No reason not to eat here, but frankly nothing that would make me want to go back either. Nice atmosphere, pleasant people, excellent friendly service and great cocktails at reasonable prices. BUT... be warned, the food here is mediocre at best Decided to try out Lüke\\'s since it was next door to the hotel I was staying at. The hostess seemed surprised that I didn\\'t want to sit at the bar because I was alone. Three parties were seated before me, but I was finally seated after waiting 10-minutes. The server took a while to get to me and only showed up sporadically to check on me, but was very friendly when he did show up. Started off with the Blue Crab Bisque - nice flavor and nice helping of crab. For an entrée I had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\". Wow!!! The shrimp was very flavorful... The grits were absolutely wonderful!!! My boyfriend and I went here last week just to try out for dinner. I don\\'t know because we came in a little late but the servers didnt give us the service like an upscale restaurant suppose to be. They put us in a corner all the way at the end where it was so dark that we had to ask for better seats, and they wasn\\'t busy at all. Then we had to ask for our plates because the guy forgot to give us when they served the bread and butter. On top of that, all the servers was messing around, talking, laughing really loud to each others. They even started to punch each others, chasing around right infront of our table. The food was ok that why I have two stars. Don\\'t know if we should come back Service is always great. Which is why it gets three stars.   The food and menu have taken a dive though.  I\\'ve eaten here at least 6-8 times over the years   It used to be really great.  The steak was Just salty, Pork Schnitzel had no flavor, gumbo also just eh.... Not worthy.  The menu has been chopped down to what seems like bar food.  Not sure what happened here!?  Everything used to be excellent.  You can do a lot better for your money in this town I feel like I should have come here for dinner! We stopped by for breakfast. The shrimp and grits were amazing (high calorie).  According to the waiter it\\'s also his favorite dish and that it\\'s even better with crawfish during the season for it! I like dark roast coffee. I think the roast used in their press is lighter. My husband had the Southern breakfast and the biscuit was too mushy. I would replace it with toast. Hope this helps breakfast hunting! Went in for dinner on Sunday night.  Fries were as good as everyone says they are.  My \"chocroute?\" skillet of sausages and pork pieces had a quarter inch of liquid fat in it, which was a little much for me and my wife, and I\\'ll try almost anything.  There are definitely better things on the menu.  Waiter was terrible, but the observant hostess was on her game, jumped in and saved the day.  Fortunately, they also sport a fantastic dessert menu - espresso profiterols & more, all excellent.  That pastry chef has got skills. Super let down. So to be fair nothing was horrible or anything like that but at this price point I think it\\'s ok to expect a little more. 5 minutes after we got our appetizers were delivered they showed up with the entrées and you either have to send your food back to sit under heat lamps or inhale your apps- they whole experience was like that - extremely rushed and not really what one would expect. Pâté was probably the only real standout - all the other items you\\'ve had before and likely better and with better service. Mint julep- Very very very strong. I guess they give you your moneys worth but I felt like I was just drinking a big cup of bourbon. I did not taste much else besides that  Gumbo- Flavorful and chunky goodness. Prob the best gumbo I had in New Orleans.  Jumbo Lousiana Shrimp En Cocotte- Loved every bite of this. Shrimp was fresh and cooked just right. Grits was creamy and perfect. This was my first time having grits and I was impressed.  Brendan\\'s Bread Pudding was ok but the Gateau  Basque Vanilla cake was gross. It was excessively sweet also very dry. Disappointing. Went w friends for dinner.   Food: It was just okay. Swordfish dish was a no. Flavorless and dry. Ribeye steak...average. Lack flavor and nice char. Some got the butter on top and some didn\\'t.  Limited menu.  Place across the street was awesome and meat seemed like a better grade.   Location/site: Clean and cute. Smaller place. Making a reservation would be a good idea.  Service: good dinner service. More of 3.5, and I\\'m rounding down. This was our big splurge meal of the weekend.  Another group of 7 ppl, and the food was only ok.  I split the seafood tower without the  lobster ($65) with a bunch of people, and everything was fresh, but I feel like there should have been more seafood for the price.  Ambience was good, up-scale without being stuffy.  I split the smoked pork shank with my girlfriend who\\'s on the Paleo diet (urgh, don\\'t ask), and it was a bit dry, in my opinion.  The sauerkraut underneath was delish though.  The bread pudding dessert was rich and satisfying.  Coffee: sooo good.  I only got decaf and it was full-bodied, and had no burnt, acidic aftertaste that is so signature of that place called Starbucks.  Everyone else seemed to be enjoying the food, and the service was quite friendly and attentive. Service was disinterested, but the food was good:  - Oysters were delicious - Gumbo was only OK. Disappointed given the raves - Shrimp and grits were really good. Really liked the touch of jalapeno.  We saw a bunch of people order the burger which looked really tasty. If I\\'m ever back in town, will try that! I\\'ve come here for lunch once but dinner was just terrible. We ended up ordering the steak and the shrimp and grits. Also ordered a few drinks which were actually delightful, so that\\'s the saving grace for the 2 stars.  Steak was well over cooked and ended up being way too SALTY, and so were the grits. Our food was barley touched and ended up being a total let down. It was surprising to see a restaurant of that caliber have issues with seasoning.  We were extremely disappointed but you win some you lose some, they did end up giving us a free dessert which was the \"Salted Caramel\". Not sure if that was unintended or clever joke. But needless to say we won\\'t be going back here again. Plenty of other places to try, so it\\'s hard to give a place a second chance. Having read the rave reviews for Luke, we couldn\\'t NOT try it out for ourselves. The food and service were good but we were disappointed that they were out of all draft beers and, a bigger sin, out of foie gras. The dish that was recommended instead (rabbit liver pate) was okay but much too rich to finish even half of it. The moules frites were excellent and the portion generous. Front of house was a touch indifferent and lacking in Southern hospitality. All in all, would still strongly recommend but perhaps check ahead of time for availability of dishes you absolutely want to enjoy. I bookmarked this place from my last visit to Nola. I was super excited to try this place! Upon arriving  the atmosphere was better than I expected (upscale).  Me and my husband ordered the chicken biscuit which is a larger plate so we decided to share. The presentation was excellent the chicken was tender, juicy, & flavorful. I also order a mimosa it wasn\\'t the best I\\'ve had I asked to have it returned and order another drink.  Upon eating half way through my meal my chicken wasn\\'t done all the way. Instead of sending it back and getting my ordered comped I paid for everything.   Honestly I don\\'t know if I\\'ll try them again I attended last night\\'s Sunday Supper at Luke\\'s.  It was really rather fun sitting with a bunch of strangers and sharing food and conversation.  I enjoyed the overall experience.  Three of the four courses were great but the coq au vin was one tough, dry bird-even with the yummy sauce.  It was authentically made with rooster, but I thought if you slow cook something long enough it would eventually become tender.  That didin\\'t happen.  On the other hand, the oysters, baked and raw, the king crab legs thermador, the butternut squash with shrimp bisque, and the baba au rhum were all great, even if the shrimp in the bisque were a bit salty.  If only they\\'d been able to pull off the main course, this would have been a five star review. All the food was excellent and prepared well.  Pricey to be sure (5 crawfish beignets with 1 tiny crawfish each for $15?), but very tasty.  The service was lousy with our disinterested waiter really putting a damper on the meal. The meal was saved when another waiter noticed, swooped in, and started taking care of us.  His name was Steve or Rich... great guy from Chicago.  At any easy $100 before tip for 2 people with 2 drinks, appetizers and entrees, I am not sure I can give a glowing recommendation.   It feels a little greedy for a small bistro with a very limited menu, but it was a very tasty meal. Saw chef John Besh being interviewed on network TV, so I decided to come to Luke to find out what the hype was.    Beautiful restaurant in an old school look.  Excellent service.  I had the shrimp cavatelli etouffee with extra fried shrimp on top.  The cavatelli with cheese was ok, didn\\'t need the extra shrimp which didn\\'t add anything to the dish.  The bread pudding was excellent.    Should have ordered the gumbo. this review is only for happy hour drinks and oysters: the oysters weren\\'t as clean,fresh and big as the oysters across the street (Trenasse) and there was very limited drinks on the happy hour menu. There were still pieces of shell on the oysters and they smelled very fishy. The fried oysters were even worse; they were very hard to chew. if you\\'re looking for a good happy hour joint, save yourself a hassle and go across the street to Trenasse (they have much bigger, fresher, cleaner, variety of oysters).  This place is overrated! My girlfriend and I came here for lunch one Saturday afternoon and we split a dozen raw oysters and the Cochon de Lait sandwich, washed down with peach mimosas. It was all very good, but it wasn\\'t happy hour!   Unfortunately, we only learned about the happy hour after our meal and since we were only visiting New Orleans for a few days, its we couldn\\'t just give another go at it. As much as we enjoyed our food, we couldn\\'t help but feel like we could have enjoyed it a lot more during happy hour. Whenever I mention to anybody that we went to Luke in New Orleans, people ask, \"Did you get the happy hour?\" and I can only sullenly lower my head and utter, \"no...\".  Without the happy hour, it just feels utterly ordinary. The food is all right, nothing special.  The service is horrendous.  They treat you like your presence is a total inconvenience to them.  We even saw the bartender roll his eyes at us.  Sorry I bothered you Mr. Fantastic, but I\\'m a paying customer and my money is as good as the lady in the Prada shoes, so treat me with a little respect.  Anyway, that\\'s all I have to say about this place. I work nearby and got takeout breakfast here one morning. The food was out quick and very nicely packaged w a separate closed container for my grits. The grits themselves were creamy but the flavor was not for me. The chicken biscuit would have been absolutely delicious, had the actual biscuit not been hard as a rock. The people that work there are nice. I will give this place another try when I can dine in. We had a reservation for three at 730 and arrived around 715.  We were seated at 725 and greater promptly by our server.  We received our drinks and the server answered all of our questions.  The gumbo was full of shrimp oysters and okra, very tasty with great consistency. The baked oysters were just \"fair\", cooked only half through.    Two of us ordered the Luke burger and one had the crab legs.  The burger was huge and has a great flavor brought out by the caramelized onions and bacon.  The fries were decent but a bit over cooked.  The crab legs presented nicely and were full and delicious.  All in all a great experience and would go back again when in NOLA! This place is insanely overrated.  I guess it\\'s good if you\\'re staying at the hotel and it has a super convenient location but otherwise I would avoid it.  The food isn\\'t bad but one of its best qualities is that it won\\'t make you sick.  I\\'ll pass next time I\\'m in New Orleans and recommend you do the same. This place was huge disappointment. It\\'s pricey and the food is mediocre with capital \\'m\\'. I had a tasty crab bisque which had a heavy taste of old bay. It was serviceable salty and spicy. Not terrible. My friend had the shrimp and grits. Shrimp really over cooked as if it had been sitting around for a while. An expensive cocktail that was very sweet. I had salad with fried oysters, avocado, and bacon. Oysters were fine, hardly any avocado, and totally generic salad. This would all be fine but the food is truly expensive. A thousand better values in New Orleans than this place. Great oyster happy hour. Some entrees are \"German\" inspired...  more like New Orleans food wearing a lederhosen.. Great apps though, hence the three stars. An ok-experience, nothing to be missed.. We ordered- Chicken n waffles- meh, the meat was ok, waffles were soggy and extremely sweet. not worth the price at all. Shrimp n grits dish - pretty good Coffee - meh Best part was they accommodated couple of vegetarians in our party.. The server was very attentive and checked with the kitchen for options.. N everybody ended up with a decent breakfast.. Portions are small though.. You need a reservation .. service is pretty slow, even the coffee refills took forever. Great expectations but didn\\'t live up to it. I asked the waiter \"How do the soft-shell crabs look today?\" \"Excellent!\" was his reply. Well, that was the skinniest softshell crab I have ever seen, and it was undercooked to boot. The dish, softshell crab with poached eggs over grits topped with a hollandaise sauce sounded too decadent. And it was. The softshell should have made this dish over the top. Instead, the itsy bitsy, skinny, undercooked crab ruined it. How disappointing that I was led astray by the waiter. In all fairness, the kitchen was slammed, although they were aware of the crowd size as all had reservations. Others at my table got the crabmeat and asparagus omlet and was very pleased. Shrimp and grits tasty but small portion. Overall interesting place but will be a long time before I return, if ever. The prices make Besh\\'s food more accessable.  The service is ok and the food, well it was good.  Normally I would expect more but given the price it is a good value.  Next time I\\'m going for happy hour and the raw bar instead of lunch. I did not realize it was part of the hotel but that didn\\'t matter.  The atmosphere, at least in the front of the restaurant, was very authentic with tin ceiling, white tablecloths and comfortable chairs.  The oysters were fresh and wonderful - not briny, buttery,and large.  The brussel sprouts were to die for with a spicy vinaigrette, almonds and apple and as a bonus, they provided the recipe.  Crab and corn bisque was rich and very tasty. On the downside, our server was totally indifferent. Rushed us and when we could not decide on our main, she abruptly left us with the feeling we were not using her time wisely and then gave us cursory attention.  If you don\\'t mind that service, the food is worth it.  I would not return however. Looked over the menu and asked the waitress for suggestions. I was torn between a couple of options which is always good. I thought I should behave and leave room for later so I found an absolutely amazing healthy option!! Had the fritata with onions and peppers and it also has duck sausage with arugula and vinegrette with chuncks of feta cheese and pesto, tomatoes, and avocado. Comes with wheat toasts. It was pretty big so I was able to finish about 3/4 of it. I would have taken the rest home if I lived nearby. Overall good service and food came out pretty quickly. Went early in the morning to get a seat. Staff wear white coats so you know its fancy. From the pictures, they serve a lot of oysters here but I did not get any whiff of fish smell which pleases me. The setting and the servers are really nice. We really enjoyed our soups as starters although they were tiny. But the beet salad I had was soggy with dressing and they put the cheese on the bottom of the bowl on purpose (because it was so strange I asked). I didn\\'t realize that when we paid $13 for crab meat it was going to be lathered in cream. My boyfriend found a long dark hair in his food halfway through his burger. The manager came over and apologized, still left the burger on the table as if he was still going to eat it. She proceeded to bring out a free dessert that we neither asked for, nor really wanted. When the bill came they had very graciously taken off the $7 coffee cup sized, little bowl of soup. Would never go back. It was ludicrously overpriced. So, we were told there was a two hour wait, stepped outside, made an Open Table reservation and where then immediately seated. Had fun waltzing back in to the same woman, looking her in the eye and saying. \"We have a reservation\".   The highlights were happy hour 75 cent oysters and half price wine along with great service from Maddie and Kenny. The pate was great and generous.   Lowlights. Crab and tuna appetizers were great, but tiny portions for $15. Did not order any entrees because I\\'m not a tourist and won\\'t pay $28 for a soft shell crab sandwich or boiled shrimp. Spent nearly $100 and left hungry. I am torn on this review as the food is awesome both at this location as well as the San Antonio, TX location and i think Besh is great.    The issue I have is that the server was a complete asshat.  I am a very positive person and will rarely call someone out on the Internet (in person where they have a chance to defend their self is more my style). this was rude to my mother and cut her off mid order then proceeded to act like a prick to my sister-in-law.  I will most likely visit other locations or other Besh restaurants instead of  this one in the future. I ordered the Étouffee of blue crab & brown shrimp, my friend ordered shrimp and grits. We came when drinks were have off (SCORE!) so ordered a sazerac and riverbend...sazerac was super strong! I thought the food was really solid. The etouffee had so much flavor and the crab was fantastic..really fresh tasting and freshly made pasta. Shrimp and grits was really tasty and had a nice spice to it. I\\'m taking off a few points for the service which was really bad. By the time we got seated it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order or even acknowledge us even though the servers past us by at least 10 times. Went here the first night we were in town.   Was not expecting the casual atmosphere, but very much appreciated it as we were so beat from traveling.  We had made a reservation, but it was Monday night and New Orleans seems to be sleeping in the beginning of the week and wakes up as you advance in days.  We loved the Flamenkuche, which was like a flatbread with onions and bacon.  Very tasty.  Very much liked the croque madame, cooked crispy and the fries were salty and plentiful.  But in my opinion if you know what a Jewish matzo ball soup tastes like, then you will want to skip onto some other choice on the menu.  I\\'d go back, but it might take awhile to go through all the other restaurants in town. 3 - okay service 4 - food 3 - New Orleans opportunity cost when there is K-Paul\\'s and others that are very New Orleans  Great food fun but too many places that are better. American Sector is a better value and also a Besh restaurant. Came here for happy hour for half off cocktails (delicious), $1.25 fried oysters (best I\\'ve ever had) and less than a dollar for raw oysters! You get the local P and J oysters for the happy hour oysters, which are quite unflavorful and full of oyster shell pieces from shucking. Can\\'t really complain though because for less than a buck a shuck it\\'s still a steal!   I would have given perfect star review had it not been for the strand of hair embedded/cooked into our crawfish.... kind of ruined the moment of a superb meal. We couldn\\'t even just pick it off because it was so cooked into the crawfish! Also, no one even came by to ask how our meal was or if we needed anything else, so we never got to show them the hair-wrapped crawfish. Had crawfish bisque,  gumbo, chicken and biscuit,  and shrimp and grits.   Ive never been a fan of bisque but theirs was very good. Their gumbo was just as delicious but a little too much okra. But thats where it ends. Chicken and biscuit with honey sauce was overly sweet and greasy. Shrimp and grits were salty. Looked great but failed on taste. + food was delicious (when we finally got it!) and good drinks and beer. Prices are great during happy hour.   - however, the service was pretty bad. orders were forgotten and took more than an hour to get an order of fries (which I had to send back b/c they weren\\'t fried enough!). Good thing they gave us our drinks before they forgot so at least we had something to keep ourselves occupied. Went to eat from the bar but service was non existent. There was a tender and oyster chucker guy but after getting a glass of wine they were not to be found.  I hung on another 20 min without service and went elsewhere.  They really need better service.  But ... Since im staying at the hilton and its a hundred degrees out I came back a few days later.  Had some coffee and vanilla cake.  Cake was five stars.  But \"fresh\" blueberries were still thawing out.  Service at the bar was a bit better but still slow. During happy hour, this place gets 4 stars.  With $0.50 oysters there really is nothing to complain about.  I have also eaten here twice during non happy hour (once for lunch and once for dinner).  I got the burger one time and the croque madame the other time.  The burger was pretty tasty.  The croque madame was good as well, but both seem overpriced for what they were. The meals come with small condiments which were a nice touch. After all my rave reviews of LUKE I finally had a subpar meal. On a previous Sunday I was here with a friend who ordered the house special veal dish. He was raving about how good it was so I decided to order it myself. I really was disappointed this time as the veal was overcooked and stringy. The gravy did not have the flavor that my friend had previously either. I was very disappointed by this dish.  We also had the happy hour oysters and cocktails which were great. I guess no place can be great everyday. I popped by Luke for the simple reason of hitting them for their HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL - $0.75 oyster, $1.25 fried oysters and half off drinks 3-6pm Everyday.  I just wanted a couple of the fried oysters, but was told that they come by the half dozen.  Okay, that\\'s fine.  They arrived in a cute fry basket, and down they went way too easily. Breakfast was tasty, but it didn\\'t blow me away. Service was great and atmosphere was attractive, upscale and clean. They lost 2 stars due to price. I felt they were priced for convenience of the hotels rather than trying to be competitive with other restaurants.   I heard they have a decent happy hour, but after breakfast being so pricey, we didn\\'t go back. I was seriously disappointed with the quality of food and service at this location. The waiter didn\\'t tell us about the happy hour specials and we had to wait 20-30 minutes for them to pack our left over food and get a check.   My gf tried shrimp with grits which was good but not worth $24. Crab bisque was the main highlight. My burger was alright, nothing to separate it from a Chillis burger and fires were stale.   Overall, this is a very pricy place ($$$) with a very mediocre quality food and service. They do have happy hour but they won\\'t tell u about it. I\\'m not sure why are there so many positive reviews, I think u can do lot better at other places. Highlights of the menu:  The burger - huge and comes with house made fries Croque monsieur/madame - high end ham& cheese (spring for the egg on top) Pate of Rabbit and Duck livers - the flavors complement each other perfectly The maple sausage served in the Southern breakfast Shrimp and Grits - the grits are a revelation (though the portion is small)  A great stop for breakfast, lunch or happy hour - I wouldn\\'t waste a coveted dinner spot since there are better Besh spots. The food was delicious. The service was mediocre.   The crawfish bisque was the highlight of the dinner. I ordered the bowl portion size and received the cup portion size. However, the owner gave me the correct portion in compliment with the cup size. The bisque had very great flavor and a nice after kick of spice!     I had the $16 burger and it was flawless! However, the condiments came in small glass bottles. It would have been more feasible to have regular bottles for condiments, as it was frustrating trying to get ketchup from the small bottles. The oyster happy hour is one if the best I have ever encountered. But I will never get over the hydrogenated oil in the pancakes or baked goods but the oysters have etched a place in me heart forever! I think they are the best I have tried in town and for the price how can u go wrong! Just get they freakin hydrogenated oil out of the pancakes and baked goods  and maybe I would do breakfast here! Because of that I give Luke\\'s 3 stars instead of 5. Hate corner cutters even if you ply me with delectable oysters. This place was a tough one for me!  On one hand, the food was fantastic.  The drink/food specials for happy hour was great, but the service, was lackluster.  We sat for some time waiting for water refills, drinks, and the food.  The food that came was wrong, although corrected quickly.  I do have to say, the Brussel Sprouts were some of the best I\\'ve ever eaten.  I may actually dream about them :).  Also, I feel like there is a time when the drinks can get \"too fancy\" where they end up tasting like cologne/perfume.  Regardless, with so many options in New Orleans for amazing food, you may want to keep walking. Meh. Wasn\\'t bad, wasn\\'t great.  From the reviews I read I was expecting to have my socks knocked off.   I had the fried chicken honey Tabasco biscuit + chicken was cooked nicely + the sweetness was wonderful -biscuit was dry - the grits that were served with it were not good. They were cold and gloopy  Husband had the crab omelette. He said it was good but not great. The fries they served with the omelette were great. Best thing we ate there. Nice think and crispy.   We did have great service though. We were just not impressed with the food. Great atmosphere. Enjoyed the baked oysters. Pricey. Sat at the bar, not so friendly bartender. But the black guy who shucks oysters was fantastic! Such a great smile and energy. He suggested the baked oysters and even had the kitchen send out two soups for us to try. Wished he was getting our tip instead. First restaurant in New Orleans.  The seafood soup was tasty.  The shrimp and grits was good as well.  My burger was salty and the fries were \"over fried\".  Thought about complaining but didn\\'t.  Service wasn\\'t great but our server was responsive when he was around.  He did end up trying to give me more fries after giving us the check. I liked Luke but I was not blown away.  I think my friend liked it more than I did.  The food was good but, with one exception, nothing overly special.  The exception was the P&J oysters which were absolutely fantastic.  If I were to go back, I would make this my meal.  Unfortunately, the shrimp and grits were average and not nearly as good as I have had elsewhere.  And the vanilla cake was really nothing more than a basic pound cake.  The atmosphere is a really cool, which I did not expect as a restaurant located in the first floor of a major chain hotel.  Unfortunately, given all the great food options in a city like New Orleans, Luke is really quite average and I would have a hard time justifying going back. I\\'ll make this short and sweet  Happy Hour Oysters - good deal   Our waitress - a super bi***** who had major attitude and was irritated that we only ordered 2 dozen oysters and nothing else. She gave some major attitude and was tooo sassy for my taste. This is the main reason this place gets two stars. Service is important! She needs to take a class! We went back and were treated by the restaurant. The server, Chris was fantastic. We were in the back area where it was a much more enjoyable experience. The food was also done perfectly. Thanks. 4 Stars for service.  Staff wasn\\'t pushy, went the extra mile, relaxed but attentive and professional.  Pate of Louisiana Rabbit & Chicken livers  perfumed with truffles  country bread croutons  10.00  Great Appetizer, reasonable price.  Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp  \"En CoCotte\"  McEwen & Sons\\' creamy  white corn grits & Poche\\'s andouille  22.00  Tasted good but overpriced. Shrimp and grits for $22.00, come on...  Luke Burger Allan Benton\\'s bacon, caramelized  onions, tomatoes, Emmenthaler Swiss  cheese with house-made fries  16.50  Good but not great.  Really enjoyed the French 75 cocktail.  Casual atmosphere, cool decor, great service, a bit pricey, kinda loud. Happy hour here is a great deal! Cocktails were just ok but half off. Oysters were similarly just ok but 75 cents. The crab gratin was tasty, cheesy, and creamy. If you like gulf oysters and cheap drinks, stop by during happy hour. As we were visiting NOLA for the first time we wanted to have a great dining experience. Luke\\'s was sadly lacking. The menu was not interesting or innovative. The dinner arrived cold and the server was too busy to check in with us. If you plan on The best part of our meal was the outstanding Oysters, which were Kumoto and from the west coast. We should have saved our money for dining in San Francisco.  Do not recommend this place for a great dining experience. Mixed review here. We ate with a group of 10. Service was awesome. Most of the food was incredible. The shrimp etouffee had enough salt to turn the Great Lakes into oceans. The grits and Flammkuchen was to-die-for good. Creamy grits. Giant burgers. Oysters fine. Pretty good burgers, sometimes a little overdone. Good fries.  My husband loves the gumbo.  Everything else is ok.  Bc it is in the CBD, it can be a pain to park at.  And it\\'s pretty expensive. Burger and fries will run about $16. Okay at best....far better choices in NOLA!   Shrimp & grits was good but tiny!!!  I have had this dish in many places and this was by far the smallest.  The girl who waited on us had a huge attitude...Shawn.  Pretty much gave us the impression that she did not care at all about if we were satisfied or not. I have been here for lunch and dinner. Very casual.  Small winelist, but lots of good stuff. Try the daily specials. The redfish and brisket specials are fantastic. Located in the Hilton which requires they are open 365.  Also try the crab salad and stuffed shrimp with orange hollandaise. Amazing sandwiches at lunch. My wife had a softshell crab blt that was enormous.  This place is slipping. Service has gotten slow. Clean, simple atmosphere. Let\\'s the architecture speak for itself. The military plaques hung behind the bar are crooked and misaligned as if haphazardly placed in a rush before an uncle came to visit, expecting to see his honors displayed. Other than that, it\\'s pretty to look at.   Crab bisque is AMAZING! Our appetizer took an insane amount of time, so they threw in a few free cups of bisque. It was the only thing we didn\\'t actually order, and it was by by far best thing we tasted.   Bartender was great- warm, nice, helpful. We\\'d definitely go back if it wasn\\'t so unbelievable crowded all the time. As my first John Besh restaurant, Lüke left me a bit underwhelmed. I went with my co workers who had always said great things about the restaurant. I went with the red fish, which was good, but not something better than a fish dish you might get at a chain like Cheesecake Factory. My colleague got the roasted chicken which actually looked amazing, and will be my choice should we return.  Ambiance was simple but nice. Service was attentive, but nothing spectacular. Bottom line, Lüke is a good restaurant, but with so many other great restaurants in the area, it doesn\\'t seem to stand out to me. \"Pearl\" in the 19$ dollar oysters. Sounds like a good deal! If you are a high fan of \"pearls\", please come here and try their oysters! 4 out of 6 times you will find a \"pearl\"! Good luck have fun! Good things: 1) As with many of the John Besh restaurants, this place has a great happy hour 2) Good oysters  We go here for happy hour pretty often, as they have 1/2 beer, wine, and specialty cocktails, along with 50 cent oysters. And they are the good, briney, yummy oysters! I would recommend the happy hour to anyone and everyone.   Since its near where I work, Ive also been there for a few \"fancy\" lunches for celebrations. The food is pretty good, its just not my favorite in the area for the category of \"fancy lunch\". The good...Calvin, and Dave were excellent servers! The Shrimp and Grits....extremely salty, but I was hungry so choked them down with two very good draft IPA\\'s. My friend had the fried oysters,  but had to be sent back since they were overcooked, chewy and dry. They brought her out some more, which were somewhat better. Dessert, the Hummingbird cake was bland and dry, very disappointing. Sent it back in exchange for the bread pudding, which was very good. Excellent staff, friendly, great service. Will not be dining here again though. I will go to the tried and true, Mr. B\\'s for their BBQ shrimp, or any other establishments that do not over salt their food. Came for happy hour specials, Oysters were small and Fried oysters my daughter had were even smaller and noting special.  Place was nice and service was good. I gave them it a three because ultimately. I come for the food. The food was good but overall the experience was average.  I ordered the shrimp and grits with lump crab and it was good. It had a nice flavor cajun that wasn\\'t too spicy,  cooked in lots of butter but honestly the grits were my favorite part?!  The boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles.  On their own the chicken and waffles were okay but overall I was not a fan.  The syrup had a weird sweet, licorice flavor to it and was really unpleasant but my boyfriend loved it so, who knows?! I came here for dinner about 8 years ago and then went back for a brunch earlier this year.  Both times were enjoyable, but the food was a little rich for my tummy.  Food was a little on the pricey side for what you get. I did find it a tad loud, so it was a challenge to hear the other people at my table talking.  All in all, I would come back to give it another try, and hope for a better experience. The Roasted Beet salad was great. I got the entrecote grille au frites . They served the wrong sauce with the steak, although good not what I asked for, cooked perfect though. The fries were cold within minutes of service. The beer selection was unique, I got Belgium ale that was great.  I would give it another try the next time I\\'m in New Orleans. Amazing service.  They have their own micro brewery which is cool.  Oysters fresh and great!  Overall food was good with good presentation. Ok.  Just ok. I had high hopes but fell flat.  Service was excellent, setting is nice and location is convenient if you are staying in a hotel downtown.  The menu was small as I expect for a better restaurant.  However, the fried oyster salad and hamburger just didn\\'t hit the spot.    Oyster salad had six fried oysters that were cooked ok but the batter didn\\'t have much flavor.  The hamburger had large smoked bacon that was mostly fat and chewy.  Had an ok taste but for $17 I expected more flavor.  The fries were excellent!!   I would give it try if I was ever in the area but can\\'t say I would make a special trip to visit  again or go out of my way to avoid if I was in a group that wanted to visit Luke\\'s. This was very disappointing to us. We really wanted to have a nice quiet evening so we could talk and enjoy each others company. However what we got was a very noisy restaurant with people yelling and screaming (most likely drunks) and the restaurant was extremely crowded. We felt like we were sitting on top of the tables next to us and could hear EVERYTHING they were talking about. We were greeted at our table but  2 (two) servers who said they would both be taking care of us. it took them twice as long to take our drink orders, serve our drinks and to finally serve our food. The food was the best part, we really enjoyed our dishes as they were cooked perfectly. We really wanted to like this place but the overall atmosphere really killed it for us. Came here for their Happy Hour.   Oysters on the half shell- half of them were clean, half still had pieces of shell and sand Fried Oysters- smaller than we expected, but better than the raw oysters Pate- very rich and mousse like We had Luke\\'s for dinner and i must say i was not impressed with a lot of factors.   The items we tried were:  Baked pesto oysters: People said this was amazing, but i thought this was alright. I\\'d rather have the char-boiled oysters or fresh oysters.  Gumbo: This was alright as well. Nothing stood out about it to me.  Ribeye steak: Pretty good flavor to the steak, however, not as tender as the other places.   Overall, I thought this place was pretty mediocre. They forgot our dinner and other tables who came in later got their dinner first, so we had to remind them. They also forgot my bread that came with the steak. It just seemed like an off day for them. Customer service was good, but not fantastic. This place is meaty! Not much for a vegetarian. The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The express menu seems like a great deal. A soup, entree and desert for around $22, I believe.   It\\'s loud but comfortable with a fun atmosphere. Went here on a friend\\'s suggestion for happy hour. Went for the happy hour oysters. The oysters were 75 cents each. They just tasted okay. I wouldn\\'t come back again because I\\'d rather pay more for better tasting oysters. Also got the brussel sprouts. Those were really good but after a while the sauce they have on them started to taste too sweet.  Didn\\'t get to try any of the other food. My food was good, loved the texture and flavor. The Lüke Salad was a bit too salty. My partner\\'s food was a bit on the blend side, the bratwurst was huge but not very flavorful. The Service was great, the atmosphere was awesome also. The interior feels like it\\'s part of an old, classic, and fancy hotel. It\\'s small but cozy. The service is nice. There are revolving doors at the entrance but they don\\'t work.  This restaurant focuses solely on food although breakfast is in the category. They don\\'t have anything else beyond coffee and tea, which was fine.   I ordered the fried chicken biscuit. It was the most expensive $14 biscuit I ever bought. The fried chicken was entirely tasteless. Maybe that\\'s what the honey was for. However, the meal came with a pile of grits that had a subtle salty taste and grainy texture I enjoyed. The biscuits were baked well. Everything but the chicken was great. Luke was a pleasant enough place, but not nearly as nice as it believes itself to be.  We visited for lunch on a Saturday, and the food was fine. My steak was a perfect medium, which was odd because I ordered it medium rare. The music was so loud that the waiter misheard us several times. A restaurant pretentious enough to have half of its menu in French should probably have more  discernment than to blast 80s pop at a volume that barely allows for conversation.  The tables were small and crowded, the food overpriced, and the wait staff unskilled. In a city filled with excellent food choices, I definitely will be looking elsewhere for a pleasant meal. Wanted to try the happy hour on the recommendation of friends/locals. The service was somewhat cold and unfriendly. The Happy Hour oysters are a great price but they quite large - not everyone\\'s favorite. Jumbo shrimp were really rubbery and hard to get out of the shell. Sour cocktail, excellent; fries, good; vegetable sides, okay. We didn\\'t particularly like the atmosphere or the service, so we\\'ll be investigating other oyster happy hours. The happy hour special of 50 cent oysters, which is daily, 3-6PM, is awesome, and that is the best thing about this place.  Oysters were fresh, great flavor, and you can\\'t beat the price.    However, the other food we tried there was only OK.  The fries had good flavor, but were super soft which is not my preference for fries.  The Salad Luke was overly dressed so the dressing overpowered any other flavors in the salad.  We also tried the gumbo, which was good, but not fantastic.    I would totally go back for the happy hour and so I will likely try other items on their menu, but I think their oysters is really the only reason to come to this restaurant. Located within Hilton Hotel, I made a reservation via opentable app. They were busy and people were having a great time. They were a bit too loud after too few many drinks.  I asked for a quite table I saw in the back but they didn\\'t want one person to sit there.  Server was friendly and fairly prompt.  I tried gumbo and oysters for a small dinner. Gumbo wasn\\'t what I remembered as a traditional gumbo. I am not a gumbo expert but it wasn\\'t what I remembered from 10 years ago.  I arrived after a happy hour but I heard they have a good happy hour menu here. I went to Luke with fairly high expectations.  The food was actually very good, but, the atmosphere was far from what I was expecting.  I had heard Luke had a nice Charcuterie dish and it was fantastic.  However, the atmosphere made my wife and I feel like we were eating at a diner .  There were plenty of people at the restaurant, and again, the food was outstanding, it was just all in the presentation of the feel of the restaurant.  I would give the food a 5 star, but, the restaurant only a 3 overall due to the atmosphere of the place.  If you are looking for high end food with a very casual atmosphere, this is the place! Was very excited to try Luke but was disappointed. Was with a group with a set menu with choices which all sounded great. Gumbo which was described as one of the city\\'s best was average at best. Duck w/ crispy rice had all the right flavors but duck was medium well w/o any crispy skin. The bread pudding was all pecans and little bread to contrast. Service was good. Maybe individual dining would be better but in a city that lives for groups you have to get this right. Restaurant linked to the Hilton on St. Charles. Limited menu item selection. Excellent soups & salads.   Happy Hour 3-6 with reasonable drink selection.  Lunch until 4. Very pricey afterwards. Excellent bar service.  Very good table service.  If female dining solo you may get missed by waiter numerous times while they seem to prefer guests dining with a male & missed for follow ups after receiving your meal, no matter how pleasant you are. As a solo diner suggest you dine at the bar so you can get served quicker Came here for breakfast and I was very disappointed. I got the chicken as waffles and the chicken was so dry and the waffles were just ehh. I wanted to love this place because I heard so many great things! But I can\\'t even finish it cause It was just okay. The taste of everything was good, just everything felt so dry.  The best thing I had there was probably the french fries. Maybe next time I come back, I\\'ll have a better expereince. It\\'s a beautiful place with very good services, and it\\'s cross street from our hotel (intercontinental). I picked it to have brunch based on the good reviews and it\\'s so close. It took about 15 minutes to sit at our table with reservation. I saw people just couldn\\'t wait any longer and just left. So if you decide to try it, MAKE RESERVATION.  As for the food, it\\'s okay. I had the shrimp grits (a little salty for my taste) and the rabbit/chicken liver. They are not bad, nothing special either.  I did enjoy the clean table cloth and attentive service for a change (since most of the restaurants in New Orleans are situated in old-dirty buildings with minimum service). When I was there, everyone around me ordered burger,fries,or po-boy. I would suggest you go else where for more authentic local cuicine. Had my first mint julep here and I discovered  that I am not a fan. It was too sweet & strong for me. I tried the mussels and fries dish which came with a ton of mussels. They didn\\'t skimp on quantity at all. Since I was visiting from Denver, a landlocked seafood less state, I was ready for any quantity of seafood. I also tried the croque madame (no egg = croque Monsieur) which was ginormous & presented on a cutting board. I tried the seafood gumbo which was really expensive but tasty. The potion could have been larger. Interior of this place is really nice with subway tiles and classic wood panels. The servers wear white coats & were very helpful and attentive. The majority of the patrons were business people. This place is walking distance from the French quarters. Don\\'t let them sit you in the back room which is SO loud.  Restrooms were clean, but smelled like sewage. There were no paper towels in the bathroom and one of the two soap dispensers was empty. Food was just not good. Simple gem salad was drenched in beet juice, it took forever to get our first round of drinks, two people in my party of 12 added crab to their salads and both thought the amount of crab was way too little for the price, two people sent back the shrimp cocktail because it was mushy and tasted funny, flat bread was good, gumbo was good, I won\\'t be back. My experience mirrors that of Jon from MN. There are just too many outstanding restaurants in NOLA to waste a meal at a mediocre spot. In addition to the fair fare, our server was incredibly lame and he obviously had received zero training. We had to ask repeatedly for water, drinks, place settings and menus. When I asked who in the restaurant knew the wine list best I was initially encouraged when the bartender appeared. That changed quickly when I asked about a Cali red and he plugged it into his phone and proudly told me what town it came from. This was the full extent of his knowledge. Lastly, I tried to give management the opportunity to respond when I shared my email address on the bill in the section where they asked for comments. I wrote, Please email Me.That was three weeks ago. Zip. One and done. John Besh\\'s restaurant is pretty good.  Its just unfortunate for Luke\\'s that I had been eating way too many great meals in New Orleans and this gets lost in the shuffle.  For an appetizer we ate oysters and shrimp.  Both were really good but pretty standard appetizers in New Orleans.  For our main entree I had the jagershnitzel.  eh.  I wouldnt order it again.  The mix drinks werent as good as I had hoped.  Overall, I was really hoping for something better here.  Maybe it was the expectations.  This is really a 2 1/2 stars for me. Maybe the cooks that night were out partying at mardi gras. Went with my gal pals for happy hour. It\\'s a cool chill place. We enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the locals. Our server was great and very attentive. We stopped for libations and a lite snack but ended up getting coffee, dessert, and a cocktail. The cocktails were a bit strong for our taste but once the ice melted a bit they were good. Will definitely visit again before the end of our trip when we\\'re not in a rush. Cool looking place and good staff but the food was just okay. I went for lunch so I assume it was a smaller menu option. I got the burger and shared the brussel sprouts and both were presented well but like I said earlier it\\'s was just okay. I was a bit disappointed!  If someone said, pick one  word to you describe your experience here?  It would be INCONSISTENT.   I ordered the ribeye steak medium well, but it came out to me with portions of the steak well done to medium rare.  My son ordered the chicken tenders and one of the chicken tender was cold.  The raw oysters were delicious and fresh, but some had broken shell pieces in them.  The french fries were unforgettably heavily salted. Didn\\'t expect this at all with the positive reviews I read. The positive is that my other son did enjoy his cheeseburger and my husband\\'s shrimp and grits were really good!  So maybe it\\'s just a different cook who dealt with theirs?  Who knows!  But if we ever do come back to NOLA, I don\\'t think we\\'ll be back here to eat again. Well, always a favorite so let\\'s start there. The French 75 is always good and the oysters are always good. The food almost never disappoints. What did tonight was service. Fully staff, or don\\'t open, or don\\'t oversell when you don\\'t have enough staff to cover. We love Luke, don\\'t make us not want to come back. Great HH from 3-6 where oysters are 50 cents and drinks are half off. The oysters were a bit sandy, but how can you complain at this price?  Service was a bit slow and our waiter said it was because the shucking station was backed up.  Understandable.  I also had a delicious red beet salad.  Upon arrival, I only saw a bunch of greens only to find layers of the tangy beet underneath.  It was topped with gorgonzola and spicy pecans.  Quite delicious!  Husband had the fried oyster bacon salad.   His advice:  Next time extra bacon and no oyster.  He didn\\'t like the way they were fried.  The cube sized bacon bits were delicious tho!  I would definitely recommend this place for if you\\'re in the mood for some oysters and a drink.    Make sure you try the homemade potato chips while you\\'re there!! 12/3/19 - updated review: I went back to Luke due to late work meetings. Well this time is wasn\\'t as great. The service was great but the food was not. I ordered the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" which was amazing the the night before. This day, it was disappointing. The decor on the food wasn\\'t the same. The dish came out cold. The waiter got it reheated but the food didn\\'t come out the same. The grits were not as cheesy and delicious as the night before. It was watery and not as flavorful. The highlight was the brusselsprouts. They were flavorful and had a hint of spice to it. Simply delicious! I was very disappointed with the grits, the dish was the only reason I came back. The plating was even different. wow super super super overpriced, this place has nothing special , also their product not even fresh order a blue crab dip, you\\'ll see what i mean  absolutely this place not recommended  there\\'s tons of places out side of downtown please look for them'"
