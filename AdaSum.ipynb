       " \"Ladies and gentlemen I give you the Gaylord Opryland Hotel. I brought my wife and parents here hoping for a good time. As you can see from the photos we sat down to eat out burgers literally surrounded by garbage. There were employees walking through but not one picked up the garbage.  I don't know if this place is like this all the time but this was our experience. I will admit the rest of the grounds seemed maintained but there is no excuse to allow your customers to eat a meal surrounded by garbage and make absolutely no attempt to remove it. I doubt we will come back.\",\n",

Then we were told a room had \"opened up\" and they gave us the key. When we got to the room (nearly 2 a.m.) it was completely trashed (garbage, dirty linins and towels).

However, the staff whom work near the meeting rooms spoke English. The room I stayed in was on the smaller.side. The room was barely \"cleaned\" after 4pm every day.

      "Good:  very clean. I saw a housekeeper wiping drawers out. Carpet, bathroom, etc all very clean. Lots to do and a neat atmosphere. Great for conferences. Bad: tiny bathrooms. Small rooms in general. Restaurants are overpriced because they can. During conferences they sell parlor rooms separate from regular rooms. NOT worth it. Though the room is large you will be sleeping on pull out sofa and wake with sore back and neck. As a Platinum member I expected to be \"upgraded\" to a regular room as there were many available due to last minute cancellations. No such luck. Make sure to book a normal room or go elsewhere. Internet speed was okay. Location is near a mall and a short cab ride to downtown. Marriott could care less about helping you.  Wow.  Love this hotel. Hate the mgmt  Also. It's music city USA and u can't hardly hear music in the hotel Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants, but what I did have was just average.   Rooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.    Cannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.    The interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults The hotel seemed fine to me for the money, even with the resort fees.  It's only 20 mins to downtown.  I do think that some of the valets need more training though.  Some of the them couldn't answer basic questions like \"where is the spa entrance\" (which is basically right there near the front of the hotel but has quirky access point).  Still, the valets were speedy and otherwise very friendly. Hotel is massive and has a lot for the family to do while I was at a convention. The rooms were a bit on the small side and we could hear everything our neighbors said. This was a problem because a bunch of college kids were on our hall and made a ton of noise. All of the restaurants are way over priced, but the steakhouse is the only one worth the money. Avoid the cascade breakfast, room service is better and equally expensive. The hotel has beautiful gardens (you don't need to stay in one of the rooms to see them, it's free so enjoy), great place to take pictures and it also has a few restaurants if you decide to eat here (some of them are ok).  Now the rooms in the hotel are not worth paying to stay in one of them. It's too expansive for just a simple old room, not worth it at all !!! It has a mini fridge, a small safe box but no microwave inside the room (you can find one by some areas where the elevators are located). This place is a joke. Always had been. Nickel and Dime you. I worked here for 10 years and was let go after the flood for no reason other than we don't need you anymore. Employees are nothing more than a number. In total agreement that this is just like a Las Vegas Strip hotel...HUGE, EXPENSIVE, but it is also clean, beautiful, and lots to see and do.  I recommend packing a big, rolling suitcase full of food and beverage to take to your hotel room, (and it will be a HIKE!) but it will save you mega bucks.  You will pay $8.00 for a Bud Light here.) I wish I had paid extra for a room with a balcony, and had smuggled in some food, and could people watch while pre-gaming! I enjoyed the sushi and service at Wasabi. I had a TERRIBLE $7 breakfast biscuit from Conservatory Cafe. Also I was not impressed with Sheldon, the front desk manager who made my check in more difficult and lengthy than it had to be.  Place was decked out for the Holidays, glad I visited  in December. Underwhelming hotel, overwhelming experience, overpriced everything, humid/smelly atmosphere, and loud.  I don't understand why anyone likes this? Yes, they have fake waterfalls and real plants inside, but it's so crowded, it's HUGE (literally could take 20 mins to get to your room), the food is disgusting, and you can hear everything at all hours. If you really enjoy vegas hotels, this is your place - lots to do if you never want to leave the hotel (which is odd to me). If you like exploring the city, good food, and a good night sleep, I'd splurge on a place downtown, or anywhere that isn't this hotel. The place is straight out of an Escher etching. You know, with all those stairs that go nowhere? I discovered this maze of stairways when attempting to find a cup of coffee and maybe a muffin to go somewhere on the premise. I never found one.  The convention facilities are luxurious. The food serviced at catered meals and receptions was top notch. Except for a business center, I could find few other places (like a coffee shop: my kingdom for a Starbucks!!!) besides sit down restaurants and souvenir stores.  I heard from associates that the rooms were nice though.  I always get giddy thinking of all those Southern guy's guys in Nashville and Dallas going around telling other guys to meet them at the Gay...lord and I really liked staying at the Gay...lord. How gay is that? This hotel is HUGE.  This place is by no means a luxury hotel, but the prices for their restaurants and rooms are outrageously expensive as if they are one.  Very poor layout causes one to easily get lost.  Workers here are friendly. Ok,  my initial disappointment has been  somewhat eliviated, but the Opryland Resort is still lacking a world-class resort feel.  Perhaps it's the purpose and theme of the hotel.  There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping.   The restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not.   Finally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.     As a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done. What a mistake staying here.  First off, I know it is a giant place and all that, which was neat to see and experience.  You have to travel a bit to get to your room, which involves waiting for very slow elevators each time.  The rooms were ok, but the walls were paper thin, you could hear doors opening and closing and talking in the hallways all night.  I also had to listen to the people in the room next to me \"making love\" - that was very loud as well.  Oh joy.    Tried to get out of the parking lot the next day took about $20 min, card was not coded and had to pay $21 for parking. Nice hotel and gorgeous views with the plants, lights and fountains. It's a Marriott property but without the Marriott customer service. $25.00 for a long line breakfast buffet for mediocre food. Parking is insane...even valet is a long wait. The ability to acquire tickets to events should be much easier and the app isn't user friendly. I hope Marriott gets involved to better the service. Poor customer service.  Oversold rooms and didn't have any available.  Very disappointed with their lack of customer service. For the price of the room we should of had better service and more perks. Free Wi-Fi would of been nice and they also blocked my hotspot from working not a good place. I am glad the FCC found this out. Attended the MGMA conference at the hotel. It was nice nothing to run home about and discuss. Overpriced merchandise and not enough restrooms for the conference room locations. The hotel itself is massive and quite impressive when you first walk in and the landscape throughout with the many fountains makes for a very nice setting.   Lines can be long for checking, they are a Marriott partner which helped us by pass or would have been 20-30 minute wait.   Pros- beautiful hotel with a lot of waterfalls, koi ponds, and  running water. Beds imo are very comfortable A lot of shopping and restaurant options.  Cons- service at restaurants and quality of food is below average.  Although there are many different places to dine only half were open.    If you are going to stay you would be best served eating elsewhere. This resort is beautiful. There are Christmas lights everywhere. There's so many things to do and see. I won't have to leave for anything.  My room is breathtaking for the price. I don't know how my sister in law got these rooms so cheap but I am happy she got them. I will post some balcony pictures just so you can get a idea of what I'm talking about.  Now the bad. I just ate at Fuse and it was disgusting. I hope it's not an indication of all the other restaurants here. Also figuring out how/where to park was crazy. These people need to do something about their food. Really this whole situation has killed my experience. Never again will I be staying here. The room was dirty, it took an hour and 15 mins to get my car from the valet, they double charged me for our room. The only saving grace to this entire terrible experience was a very helpful gentleman named Ryan at the front desk that ironed out all he could with the double charge. For $259 a night I will stay at a motel 6 before I stay here again. The staff at the spa are incredibly friendly and professional, but the rest of the staff are sub-par. It's too big, I think, to provide good customer service. I got lost getting to my room as the front desk staff did not tell me the correct directions (he even gave me a map where he highlighted the wrong way!!) The food and service at the Conservatory Wine Bar are AWFUL! The Margherita pizza literally was a flatbread with tomato paste as the sauce (and burnt tomatoes!).  None of the housekeeping staff will say hi in the hallways...which is a sure sign they are not happy here! Too bad...what a gorgeous hotel to mess up!!! Very massive hotel, a lot to look at. The biggest downside is the fact that the hotel is very business-centric in the sense that everything is monetized and pretty expensive. The restaurants in the hotel are great, but expensive. The room service is really good, but really expensive. You can tell that the biggest feature of this hotel is the hotel itself. The atrium rooms are amazing, but wondering if it was worth the premium we paid for them. Seeing as we paid more for a room here than we would have in New York City, I wish they were a little bigger. The bathrooms feel a bit dated compared to some of the more modern hotels. Rooms are old but clean. Resort is huge and I'm glad we got to stay here and experience it. But will not go back. Restaurants are ok. Loooooong wait to get into the bars of you go on a Friday night and it's after 9:30 PM. Stayed one night here in Dec '10 after getting \"snowed in\" in Nashville..yep, snowed in! This is a fun place to stay...kinda Vegas style accommodations. As someone who gets to Vegas a few times a year, I have to say I enjoyed staying downtown at The Hermitage...and it will be my choice again next time we head out to Nashville. horrible housekeeping, concierge, restaurant service!! do not stay here if you value respect or customer service! This hotel is very nice, but disappointing for a conference venue. All of the shops close early in the evening...and don't expect to have a late dinner or cocktails, the restaurants close early as well. We had a party of 20 and were asked to leave the Finley Irish Pub because they wanted to close @ 10:00pm. Gorgeous hotel, beautiful gardens and well kept walk ways. However don't come here looking for any southern hospitality, the staff is incredibly rude and when you ask anyone for directions no one seems to understand how to give them. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for guests with smaller children. Much better for an adults getaway! This place is not for families. Be prepared to spend 450-500 dollars in food for three days. 24 dollar milk and cookies. No food from outside is allowed.  Restaurants in the hotel are more expensive than anywhere else in Nashville.  Ordered a pizza from outside restaurant staff was very hostile to me when I brought it in to hotel. this place reminds of camping. it is not a resort. we had a block of rooms reserved for 6 months and when we checked in two people were given rooms with no beds ! how could a marriot resort even think that is acceptable. management did not correct the issue after several requests. i checked out. there are several nice hotels near resort with shuttle service. a confirmed reservation means nothing - even if a marriot elite membet. i would have rated zero if possible. Very nice facility everything's top notch. Why they have one real restaurant for breakfast is beyond belief. Only 1! You can drink Starbucks until your head explodes and eat that \"food\" but otherwise you wait in line forever. This place holds thousands of people and there are around a dozen restaurants open for lunch and dinner but breakfast..forget it! This place would be an easy 5-star if it was just rated for beauty of the hotel and grounds. It's absolutely beautiful and relaxing. However, you are pretty much stuck there for meals. The hotel is massive and there just aren't enough facilities for lunch and breakfast. The pool is way too small but they are fixing that soon. It gets old waiting in a one hour line for breakfast and lunch. There are long lines at the convenience stores and just about anywhere you can get food. That being said, we love it and will be back. Great staycation for a weekend. Terrible service. Check in was delayed by 2 hours. Took an hour to get the car out of valet after being told it would be 15 mins. Missed most of a dinner date with friends because of it. Rooms are outdated for the price and we were in the \"nice\" area. Normally when traveling for pleasure I like to stay at a W or Westin. This was of lesser quality for a higher price than the hamptons I stay in for work. Really wish I would have stayed at the days inn across the street because I could have had the same experience (or better) for less money. Stayed here for a meeting we had at Vanderbilt. Not sure why the coordinators at Vanderbilt would set us up here. First it required a 15-20min drive to get to downtown area and besides the Disney-esque ambience in courtyards there's nothing special here. The rooms are quite basic. The beds are relatively uncomfortable and they literally have THE worst pillows you could imagine. I would recommend staying at the hilton in downtown or something but I won't be coming back here. Also beware of extra charges. Be prepared to pay $20 a night for parking and $18 resort fee per day. So I do a lot of conventions Orlando Las Vegas Nashville seems to be the theme however I checked into the Nashville Gaylord and can't even get a charge by my bed however I did fix it by changing the lamp from the desk to the one by my bed that has an outlet how hard is that this is not a huge Convention it's a little smaller than the ones that I usually go to. Stayed in a lot better rooms at the same exact price you have to give a discount for the ones that are not accommodated yet or remodeled Just recently stayed at the hotel.   The staff was rude, inconsiderate and non-caring. The restaurants were always closed for private events and it was not an enjoyable stay.   Not Impressed at all! The Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center is one of Marriott hotels.  There are several on-site restaurants, spa treatments, and fitness activities available for hotel guests.  I particularly enjoyed the atrium view, as you can some of the suite's balconies, and an expansive enclosed area with a tropical weather, allowing palm trees and other topical plants to flourish.  There are water fountains and a stream, weaving throughout the atrium area.  Great place to soak in the views.  There are also rooms available to rent and to utilize for conferences and/or meetings.  Starbucks coffee dispensers are also upstairs where you use your card to get a cup of joe.  Parking is limited and can be very price if you're park on-site; however, you can park in the mall area and just walk across!  +atrium view This is our second Christmas visit.  We will not be returning.  On arrival it took 30 minutes for each person to be checked in.  Lines were long.  On the second day we tried to leave the parking lot and our card would not work.  Cars were backed up.  We all called trying to get someone to come out and help us.  No one came.  Finally another resident used their card and we were all able to get out.  The final insult was to get home and find that a large number of our clothes were missing.  Many were new from Christmas gifts.  We tipped the hotel staff every day.  We will never return.  For the prices we had to pay in premium rooms we are greatly disappointed. What a huge disappointment. Note, we did not stay there but since we were traveling through Nashville on St. Patrick's day, I thought I would take my wife there for dinner and to watch the NCAA bracket announcements. I had heard and read that there was a great sports bar in the hotel. Drove over, found out we had to PAY $20 JUST TO PARK.  So, came that far so figured what the H. Wandering around the hotel took quite awhile to find Fusio? We asked several employees and it seemed like we kept getting incorrect answers. Finally found it, and guess it was closed. A Sports bar closed on the day the NCAA's were announced?  And Jack Daniels was closed. We ended up eating at the Irish Pub where the food was just so so and expensive for what we got. I came, I saw, I won't return. I understand the appeal, but not my cup of tea. Was here over the weekend since my boyfriend had a room for a work event the following week. Very crowded and very manufactured, like all of the Gaylord resorts. If you've never been, it's a cross between a Disney world resort and a wannabe Vegas resort. The hotel common areas are very pretty, with lots of foliage and greenery throughout the atrium, but the rooms were just okay and a little outdated. For what a room costs, especially an atrium view room, I expect the cleaning to be better. The closet for hanging clothes, safe, ironing board etc has not been cleaned in a very long time. The shower drain was clogged so it took about 5 minutes after we were done showering that the water would be gone. It took me three phone calls to reservations (was disconnected twice) and then 24 minutes on the phone to reserve two suites.  I pity my co-workers who have to stay here. Honestly, I'm severely underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong the hotel is huge, entertaining and with beautiful atriums and many walkways but it's insanely overpriced! Everything is. The rooms. The food. The drinks.  It's not worth the price for the size of the rooms and the service.  I'd recommend getting a cheaper place and going to the various attractions around town. I don't write Yelp reviews generally because I feel like they unfairly categorize an establishment that everyone has a unique and different experience with. The only time I write a review is when a place is unarguably amazing or stunningly awful. Gaylord is the latter. It's an incomprehensible monstrosity. Ill keep this short and to the point. Laughably overpriced. Horrendous, and I mean God-awful, food. Fruit flies in droves. The most apathetic, unprofessional, poorly trained staff imaginable. This place is just plain depressing on every level. They care more about waterfalls than people.  Stood standing in my room on the phone waiting for someone to pick up so I could order room service.  No dice.  Called the front desk.  They put me back in the phone tree.  More wasted time and told to wait.  Called back and asked for a manager.  Shelly said I'd have to wait.  All she had to do was take my order so I didn't have to stand in the middle of the room any longer.  Of course not.  40 minutes later I wound my way through their stupid jungle and sat at the bar. No food there.  Had to go over to their less than relaxing sushi bar for $40 central TN fish.  Thanks Gaylord.  I was exhausted and wanted in room delivery.  Seemingly a simple request for a trillion dollars per night.  They failed miserably. 3 pools, acres of indoor gardens, 20+ restaurants, 1 PLACE to GET COFFEE!!!   And a line of 30 people waiting.  Come on... Atrium area was very nice and decent restaurants. However, people at customer service were not helpful at all and marketing of the rooms was very false. Paid for a junior suite and was given a large empty room with only a bed and a couch in it. No decorations of any sort. Took half an hr at 1am to be given an new room which was much nicer but did not have a pull out couch as advertised for the third guest. Then took another hr to try to get a third room or a roll away bed. Took over 2 hours in the middle of the night to get even close to what had been promised. Inexcusable. Will definitely not be staying here again and would not recommend it. Enjoyed staying here. The scenery and the hotel room was very nice. Parking and food was absolutely terrible. Parking is $28 to self park and $38 for valet. It is not included in your stay. We did self park and always had the hardest time finding parking especially at night. So we were forced to valet two nights in a row.  Also the restaurants were so disappointing. The wait was extremely long for most of the restaurants. The food was over priced and definitely is not worth the price.  Definitely stay at this hotel but drive out for food. This place is the worst marriott I have ever stayed in, and I am a Platinum member. Total rip off every-time you turn around. It should not be called resort, because there is nothing to do. Only one or two of the restaurants are open each night and they are all atrociously overpriced. And they charge you 20$ per person for a shuttle to go into town. 25$ a day in parking, and 4$ for a coffee. Its like a bad joke. Trust me look elsewhere. Id rather be at the courtyard. At least there I can get a reasonable breakfast for under 20$. Great resort! Especially during not so ideal weather since it's indoor. Rooms and service are great but the restaurants suck. All of them. Go off resort for your meals Waaaaay too huge.  It takes forever to walk to your room or a really overpriced restaurant.  The staff everywhere is very helpful and polite but this place drives me nuts. So, I've been waiting over a month now for that refund and haven't gotten it and they're not responding. So, yeah, that clinches it. Thanks for promising a solution to the problem and not following through. Absolute Worst Hotel I've ever come across! Booked a room 3-4 months in advance for a convention and trade show I was attending. And arrived to the hotel to have the staff tell me and everyone else in line that their hotel is \"first come first serve\" and that our reservations apparently don't mean anything. They had given our room away, and gave us vouchers to stay at a hotel 20 minutes away! Front desk staff had a shitty attitude,  and the manager didn't seem to care much that they overbooked the hotel and had to send everyone away! Decided to give their vouchers back and stay at a Hilton, rather than give them anymore business! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!! Only writing a review for walking around inside not staying at resort. Most importantly DO NOT PAY $24 to park. If you are just walking around for a few hours park in the mall parking lot next store- short walk to one of the entrances. It was OK to spend an hour. Fountain is really cool and it is amazing how big it is inside- got to take a lot of AC in August that's for sure. My family's first trip to Nashville and heard this was the place to stay. But I am disappointed. I did not upgrade to a better room and regret it. We had an exterior room over looking a rock roof and partition parking lot. It was older and poorly lite. Just depressing.  The highlight was the abundance of food options.  Looking forward to a visit in the future with new water park. If you are interested in overeating and waiting in long lines to do it, this is the place for you!  Obviously I am joking but they cater to a specific crowd -- older, heavy, and out of shape.  There are not many healthy dining options but, on the positive side, you will have the gym and spa to yourself.  The hotel rooms are dated but functional.  High-speed internet access is spotty and that is particularly strange for a place that caters to business meetings.  If you have to go there because of a conference, make the best of it.  But I wouldn't choose to go. I booked a room a couple of months ago. We arrived there today, travelling from NJ and were turned away because they were overbooked. The clerk at the front desk summoned a manager who apologize matter of factly, telling us that \"upper management\" regularly screwed things up. She offered to get us a room in a downtown Radisson which we declined. We have traveled quiet extensively and this has never happened before. Very shabby way to treat people. Book somewhere else. Opryland Resort was listed as a top thing to do in Nashville so we decided to go. I had heard that the grounds were beautiful and they are nice. There are 50,000 plants of 500 different species. But it's really just a big hotel. Parking is $24. Some of the restaurants will validate so if you eat at one of them the parking will be free.  Most the restaurants had a wait time and seem a little pricey. We ate at the sports bar. Food disappointing and service slow. With all of the entertainment along Broadway, I thought there would be entertainment in several areas with a place this large but we didn't see any. Unless you like walking around a really big hotel, I would pass on Opryland as a must do while in Nashville. We are here for a conference on a Wednesday and all but 2 quick food places are closed. The lines are ridiculous and we only have an hour. This hotel is by far the worst hotel I've stayed at my life I travel at least twice a month mostly on business trips. I first want to start by saying that when I checked in the front desk associate didn't speak any English.  I purchased two rooms that were supposed to be connecting she assured me they were sure enough they weren't.   When I tried finding the room the associates and cleaning people in the hallways didn't speak English as well.  Ice went to the front desk after 45 minutes of looking for my room and spoke to the front desk manager Wesley.  He was absolutely no help. I will never go back to this hotel again Marriott platinum member. This was one of the worst stays ever. Here for 4 nights for a meeting. Front desk treated me poorly. Room was terrible and very noisy. I could on and on. I would give it zero stars if possible. Very disappointed to be treated so poorly as a platinum member. Just attempted to check in to a room I reserved 3 months ago to find out they gave the room to \"more important guests!\" However, they were accommodating enough (insert sarcastic tone here) to get us a room downtown. Unacceptable! If I wanted to stay downtown, I would have made a reservation myself. Will never stay here because they treat certain guests like second class citizens. Never stay here! Instead book a room downtown. Stayed here for three full days in December and I will start with the food: Place is beautiful and very clean  Now for the bad: Place is huge, had to walk mikes to reach the room Staff was nice enough but VERY slow and not near enough people to help. Took 30 minutes to valet, 59 person line at check in, ice cream line at night was 20 people at all times Food at Solario the Mexican place was horrible. Service was not good, selection was tiny and food basically sucked Finally tons of old people moving super slow!  I would NOT suggest this hotel for anyone Stayed at hotel for conference. Customer service is really lacking. Waited in a long line to check in and only 2 people registering guests. Clerk was rather rude about credit card info was not faxed even though room was already paid for. Signage for conference was minimal and difficult to follow. When I came back to my room at lunch break there were men were in my room. I was told my room was vacant and I must be at the wrong room. When I produced my key and pointed to all of my belongings then they finally left. My room was not cleaned by 5pm and when the maid arrived he asked if I wanted towels. I guess they don't clean the rooms everyday. The hotel is beautiful. Food is marginal at best. The hotel is beautiful, but some of the people working in the stores were very rude and not service oriented. Room Service was pathetic. They arrived at inconsistent times during our stay; the rugs were dirty enough to make your socks look dirty; mold growing in the shower. Room Service was exceptional! Take everything that sucks about San Antonio (Riverwalk, bad restaurants, tourist overload, smells) and put it all under a glass roof in Nashville. Voila, Gaylord Opryland. So far 45 minutes in valet line to check in and still 2 cars back. So, not worth a dime in my book. Update, very slow morning... Still waited over 20 minutes to get car so we could leave for town. Did enjoy watching the valet guys stand around and play shadow basketball. Good times Came for few days for conference. I would never voluntarily stay here. Basically the quality of a holiday inn but with large fake garden in it. Food is very low quality. You always expect to pay more when stuck somewhere, but Gaylord charges exhorbitant mark up. Breakfast of scrambled eggs with home fries and milk...$30. It has all the kitsch of Vegas or Disney, same prices, but no casino or entertainment. Not close to downtown Nashville. Would not voluntarily subject myself to the Gaylord opryland. Really bad - stay away! Pretty much a zoo of a hotel. If you want to pay too much and have a difficult stay in a bit of a run down hotel, you'll love it. It's really bad. Beautiful resort.  Really nicely decorated rooms with great beds.  Horrible pillows. Great towels and toiletries.  Water goes hot to cold very and back very quickly.   Too many unattended children running up and down the hallways which you can hear in your room.   After three nights I felt like l was trapped in the biosphere praying for fresh air.   I won't be back. A few things related to lack of service were frustrating. What finished it was we checked in at Cascades, they put us in Magnolia. I valet parked and showed valet I was in Magnolia and the front desk wanted them to move my car to Magnolia. Never happened. Waited over 20 minutes for my car. We were there for a family dinner last Sunday and we had to be guided over to where the dinner was at. The place was huge! And parking, oh don't even get me started on that! The parking lot itself is a huge maze! The food was subpar, nothing like I would have expected from the Gaylord. The tropical plants were cool to look at, but it all felt very cheesy and overdone. The waiters were very nice. The only good thing about the dinner was the peach cobbler! I ate three little servings of that and I'm not a big fan of peach. I had to add some sugar to it but it was really good. That's the only reason why this place gets a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating. Poor customer service and phone etiquette by some of the staff, Sig delays in responding to phone calls.  Woken up at 3AM by security loudly banging on the room door to ask if water was running in my room...No it's not, it's called \"sound machine\"!!! Waking me up for this??really?? H&R block convention Lots of confusion and terrible wait times for rooms. Didn't get checked in till 10 pm after several attempts of waiting in long lines. I'm a Marriott Elite member and didn't get that experience here. Left bags and waited 25 min and still no bag... Valet said oh I forgot about you, really??!! Went to Wasabi to eat while waiting for room and food was good but service mediocre - forgot half of order.  We booked this hotel based on its previous experience 4dx model but it's obvious that has fallen off. Overall nice place but needs some focus on customer service. Beautiful resort, with a lot of little shops...overpriced of course. Employees were not very friendly and that says a lot about a place. Short older concierge with reddish hair was particularly rude.  Room was nice but oddly the bed wasn't that comfortable. From the outside you may think you are going to be walking into the must see place in Nashville but just like most tourist traps this one turned out to be just OK.  This is not a must see place in Nashville so if you have limited time mosey your way past this place.  The hotel is huge and it looks like you are in a theme park.  I really think the reason why there is so many people walking around is because they all can't find their rooms.    So if you have extra time...check the place out.  Food is very overpriced and there really isn't that much to see but it is an OK way to spend an hour or two. Trying to use my \"no black out dates\" Marriott Elite rewards points...no rooms available. Not using rewards points, hundreds of rooms are suddenly available. I'm not sure how this is legal (it certainly isn't ethical), but I forwarded my experience to the applicable federal agencies. Maybe maybe maybe this kind of thing will finally be looked into. This Hotel is just too big.. period.  It takes you days to find your way around.  If you have a convention there, don't pick up a lot of freebies.  You walk forever to get back to your room. I travel a lot and I'm not a fan of this hotel at all.  It is beautiful, lots of amenities and great restaurants.  BUT  you end up giving / spending all your money at Gaylords.  At end of the day you are too tired to go off site to eat or dine. The views are stunning.  The restaurants within it are mediocre at best.  The boat tour is a canned tape that loops and loops. Really? Old, outdated, terrible service, shall I go on? This hotel charges a premium for rooms and banks on the fact that large conventions have no other choice. I recommend you find an alternative. Room key systems that are wildly outdated requiring you to go to front desk to reactivate daily. Staff that wishes they had ANY other job and are very rude. Room amenities that resemble a Super 8. If you're considering the Gaylord vs another hotel or city, go with option B So I went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night to look at lights. We basically parked and were inside for less than an hour and parking cost us $24+tax... would never go again for that price. Ridiculous. Gave two stars because of the appearance of the hotel.. It is amazing. But that is where it stops. I judge a hotel on the helpfulness and the friendly and welcoming attitude of the staff and this staff has none of those qualities mentioned here..   Boarder line rude and nonchalant attitude with no desire to make you feel welcome.. All that I met so far is non caring  and wanting a big tip. Got no help in unloading my bags from the taxi, the gal who check us in had no clue what she was doing because when I asked her a question she said \"whatever\".. Great response..  I hope I didn't make a mistake and could have saved money, time and been welcomed somewhere else.. Spent New Years here I was very disappointed. When we checked in no one could help us find our room. We asked three people!!! How can u work in hotel and not know where to go ???   NYE was s joke!! If I was 20 something snd sleezy I'd go back, but never again will you spend the money on the hype that isn't really s hype!!!   Hotel even messed up our NYE dinner pldnd cause allegedly they didn't know restaurant closed at 9??? How How again can you work in hotel and have no clue what goes on???? So disappointing!!!! Expansive complex bordering on the Vegas end of being complex and taking 20 mins to walk to your room from anywhere. Food is overpriced and only mediocre. (mexican restaurant was so-so...italian was Great).   Waterfalls around the property are an interesting addition...adding scenery and some needed white noise to help with the awful acoustics but at times makes it hard to talk at some of the bars because they are so loud.   Common areas are done up nice and are very pretty during christmas time. This weird biosphere is full of 50-60 year old folks with their kids. And littered with weird restaurants, who cater to people too afraid to go downtown or something.   My favorite part of this place was the \"vegas style night club\" inside called \"Fuse\".   I walked by it once at around 6:30pm and it was sporting a line to get in. Maybe it hadn't opened yet. I wonder if the bouncers keep anyone out? You'd have to feel like an asshole if you pay 250$ a night only to go to Fuse, the night club for patrons, that won't let you in. This Resort Hotel was slightly disappointing. While beautiful, there were definitely some flaws. The Thanksgiving buffet at Ravello was priced extremely high and the food was only mediocre and actually a bit cold. One major disappointment was the fact that they advertised SmartTVs that had access to Netflix, and Netflix did not work! It kept stopping and reloading which made the viewing experience difficult to enjoy. It ruined a family tradition, and when we asked the front desk for help, all they did was unplug and replug the TV and it did not make a difference. My family and I spent 3 nights and 4 days at the resort and I would not do that again! Overall, my experience was not the best and I don't think I would recommend my friends and family to stay at this resort. The largest non-casino hotel in the US definitely lives up to it's title.  This place is huge and it is quite easy to get lost in it.  Having been to the other location in Orlando, I can say that I prefer this location.  The staff are extremely helpful and nice, and the food choices, although priced for a resort, are plentiful.  Going for a convention is great, as you really don't need to go out for much if you don't want to.  It is within walking distance to the Opry Mills mall, the Grand Ole Opry (they also have a free shuttle there), and they have a shuttle to downtown Nashville for a nominal fee (much less than taxi). Horrible place to stay if you have young kids.  Live band in the Delta Atrium outside our hotel window played so loud our bed vibrated and our windows shook.  Played for 2.5 hours.  Kids couldn't sleep.  We couldn't read or watch TV.  Staff was unsympathetic.  Had to call MOD, Jessica who also wasn't sympathetic.  After not letting her off the hook and trying to understand how our room was worth $400/night, she finally offered a meager $50 deduction on my room rate.  Won't be staying here again! The size of the hotel doesnt matter, but the size of your room does. Ours was yery small and cramped. My family had a horrible time, everything was overpriced, and they didnt want you to leave. We should have stayed in the downtown area. The waterfall gets annoying after a while too. Very cool at first glance.. huge and I mean HUGE layout. The different atriums are pretty sweet to walk through and check out. However, it's overwhelming. The simplest of tasks are instantly difficult to accomplish due to the fact that this place is massive and takes about 2-3 solid days of navigating to grasp. Need to head out to your vehicle because you forgot an item... that's a 20min ordeal.   The rooms aren't anything special, I'm easy to please, but for the price of this place the rooms could use some TLC.   Not a bad place to stay, just huge and overly complicated for me. I'm good at a holiday inn..... Greed has an address, and it's here.  Arriving by car?  $23 per day to park (this is Nashville, not Oslo).  Wifi?  That'll cost ya.  Even a Pepsi in a machine is $3.  If Marriott and Hyatt can crack the code on providing great amenities at a reasonable cost why can't this place?  At least they don't have a coin meter on the toilets (yet).  Oh, but beautiful facility.  It really is. Plenty of hidden charges. $18 required hotel fee that includes wifi? That should be included regardless. And you have to pay $28 to park your own car. Ridiculous. Made our stay expensive and a pain in the rear.   Fine rooms and property. Just bad business model. We won't return. While a very nice clean resort, and a place where it is primarily a conference hotel resort, the layout is the most confusing hotel I have ever stayed at. I would not recommend this place if you are on vacation.  It is almost impossible to navigate around the place.  Given it is a huge hotel, they should have people all around guiding you.   Virtually everyone walking around had trouble trying to figure out how to get around the place.    Stay downtown if you can Rooms are fine and the hotel itself is incredible. Gave three stars because the room prices are already astronomical yet they charge 24.00 per night to park plus the 18.00 \"resort fee\" per night. This place is just too big and not laid out well. I came here for a conference and was so excited until I arrived. The rooms are dated and my first room felt dark and light dirty so i asked for a new room and was given a nicer room in a different section. I got lost on a daily basis. The resort is massive and the maps aren't as helpful as they should be. The restaurants weren't open at times there were supposed to be open and in addition were very over-priced for average food. Your best bet is to walk or shuttle to the nearby mall.  Housekeeping did a nice job every day.   I wouldn't stay here again. The resort is beautiful and centrally located.  As a new visitor to Nashville it was easy to get to all the tourist attractions. We were charged for every additional service that you would normally expect to be included (WiFi etc), but the service workers tips are not included, so be careful what you get and be sure to tip cash. Room service is overpriced but the food is outstanding. There are free places to park, which I recommend and just use the shuttle. Sorry but the place has changed for the worse.  I have been fortunate enough to stay at all the Gaylord's, Orlando, Washington, Dallas, and here in Nashville  more than a few times over the years for business. This location is far from what it used to be. First the resort add-on fee is grossly inflated and self parking prices should come with a full detail for the rate.   Valet prices is equivalent to a nice dinner, lol.   Food is subpar and expensive is not a fair word, let's go with ripoff.  Mediocre food at insane prices.  Skeleton staff.  Most of the nicer restaurants are not open every day. Room service add 20% PLUS a delivery fee. Sad because this was once a great place. Staff attitude is also very dry.  Seems they just want the day to end so they can go home.  Much better options for what they charge. As a resort this place briefs well and looks really good on the surface, but don't believe the hype.  I've given it a shot 3 times now (hoping I stayed on bad weekends) and all three were disappointments.  Minus the Old Hickory Steakhouse, the food is horrible...carnival quality with white tablecloth prices.  Speaking of prices, you are hit with daily resort fees and outrageous parking add ons.  The housekeeping services are quality, but they do not separate the extended stays from the checkouts.  Bottom line, expect to be woken up early by a motovated housekeeping staff member.  Resort services are lacking (all though you pay for them), simple things like towels available at pools, spa appointments (Crazy Expensive BTW), and checkout options.  As a Marriott regular, I will not stay at this property again. Besides the amazing decor in the hotel and the fact that this place is like a mini disneyland, everything else is mediocre. The rooms are nice, clean, and mid-modern, and the staff are extremely pleasant.  I really dislike how far it is to walk from the conference room to my hotel. Room service is very expensive ($12 for a burger, $4 for service, then they tack on 40% or something for in-room dining, equal to a $20 meal for a burger).  I would recommend people stop by this place to check out the inside. Ouch!  Generally when you spend over $200 for a room they do not then charge you a $15 resort fee which gets you two bottles of water and a dial up speed internet connection. A 8 oz bottle of orange juice is $3.21 in the gift shop!  I can buy a gallon for that price.  This is a nice hotel but they gouge you on the prices. Bring a lot of money if you are going to stay here. Also the room is small and I have a view of the parking lot! I guess someone has to get the third rate rooms. When you pull up it is unreal how big this place is.  When you walk in you instantly say \"wow\", then when you finally get to your room you are like this plain room doesn't go with this big resort.  We were disappointed with that, but the room was clean with a comfortable pillowtop mattress.  Check in was prompt.  No problems with rude employees like several of the comments on here.  Be prepared to walk, walk, and walk some more.  The mexican restaurant on the property is the worst mexican food I have ever tried.  We can say we have been there and done that, but probably wouldn't stay again... not worth the price.  Been to resorts much nicer for less money. Come and see the gardens a couple hours before going to the Grand Ole Opry immediately in the same parking area.  This hotel is a very nice hotel - comparable to a Las Vegas hotel with a beautiful atrium, indoor gardens, convention center, outdoor pool, spa, etc.   The problem is the location in Nashville.  Besides the mall (Opry Mills) and the Grand Ole Opry immediately next door, there is nothing to do here.  The hotel has some cute restaurants and bars, but unless you are there for a convention where all your coworkers are staying and eating with you, the restaurants and bars are pretty dead.    There just wasn't enough going on in this hotel for me to rave about it, but it really was nice. 1.5 hours trying to get parked and checked in. Terrible excuse for customer service. This is the most poorly run operation that I have seen in a very long time. Customer service is non-existence. You would think for $3,500 for two nights three days that maybe I wouldn't hate it from the minute I set foot on the place. Worst customer service I've experienced at a Marriott ever.  Totally understaffed.  Lines everywhere.   Valet service was completely disorganized.   Today couldn't even call ahead.  Last two days the operator would hang up after waiting 15 minutes on hold.    Lines to evenhry a coffee were crazy.  It's as if they never had thanksgiving weekend rush before.  Staff also totally rude Ok Management if you read these.....Good place but PLEASE, PLEASE have better directions to the rooms, this place is huge and the only complaint I get is people getting lost. The signs are dismal, there are renovations PLEASE listen to these comments and make it easier. The map you give us is hardly readable. I have to give you credit for your employees who drop everything to show you to your room....IF they are around. Big turnoff and unless you change this flaw will never stay again. While on the subject, time to upgrade your rooms you are nothing better than a regular medium range chain..sorry. The Gaylord has a beautiful interior. However, I received a dirty, outdated room facing the parking lot. The carpet is filthy. The AC in my room was not up to par. On top of it, I requested an interior facing room and was denied.  VERY disappointed in the Gaylord. Holy crap is this place huge. You don't wanna close down one of their bars and then wander around drunk and disoriented, wishing for bread crumbs and a magic teleporter back to your room. Trust me, I've been there. On the upside, hotel staff are very sympathetic and accommodating to drunk, hysterical guests at 2am. We visited the Opryland this year to shop and look at the christmas decorations.  It seems like even the Opryland scaled back on the decoration this year. We were a little disappointed, unlike in previous years, it wasn't much of a winter wonderland.  I love to shop at Savannah's for Christine Alexander clothes and now they have a new shop called Angels and Cowboys. I wish I could have afforded some of the clothes in there, but they were beyond my meager budget, especially after already shopping at Savannah's......  Parking is really outrageous, we were only there for 2 hours and it's 18.00 no matter if you drive and drive out, or stay the whole 24 hours. Room is very nice...Parking is $32 a day and stinks! Some self parking gates work, some dont, parking attendant didnt have good grasp of property.  I had to call the front desk to find a lot...frustration level high! They have gotten too big. .. If you are visiting Nashville you have to check this place out! I would never stay here, but stopping by to see this monstrosity is a must. It's approximately 800 acres under one roof, I think we saw about 1-2 acres in all. Just had to try to ignore the fact that they are probably killing the earth all by themselves with all of the resources they use. The service and food do not match the beautiful facility. Everything was very clean. The majority of our interactions with the staff were okay, nothing great but a few less than great. The resort was full during our stay and many of the restaurants were closed during meal times. On Monday, the pool Café was open for lunch, when we went on Tuesday, at the same time, it was closed. Worth a night or two stay to experience, would recommend eating somewhere closer to town...for better quality and value. Just okay. It's ok rooms not to good air don't work right in room there's extra charges to room even if you pay for somewhere else self parking $23 a night plus tax and $18 a night for resort fee it's over priced for what you get!! I remember coming here several times when I was young and thinking this building was larger than life. Coming here as an adult, it's still quite daunting but not nearly as mystical as it is when you're ten years old. I walked through almost the entire property in about 45 minutes and while it's still beautiful, it's lost some of its magic. Still a must visit place if you've never been. Beautiful hotel.  Gardens are beautiful.   Opted for the boat ride inside the Delta.  I know, a bit cheesy but I have to tell you overall very interesting.  Learned a few nuggets about the hotel etc.  My only complaint is the price of parking.  We didn't stay at this  hotel.  We just came to enjoy the grounds.  Regardless if you are there an hour or all day the parking is a flat 24. Very disappointed with my room. The bathroom is disgusting ... Mildew in the grout in numerous places, bathroom wallpaper pulling away from wall. Just gross.   On ground floor with a door that opens into the parking lot. I might as well be staying in a motel! So not safe!   And I'm seriously let down too...I stayed here for my first anniversary and it was so great. Is it because I'm paying a groups rate for a teaching conference? Either way, very disappointed. Outdated room, room smelled, people next door partied all night.  Valet lost our vehicle, waited 2 Hours for them to find.  Fuse sports bar was expensive with subpar food. Now I understand the low ratings. The people were friendly, grounds were beautiful and beds comfy. What ranks it low and makes it so frustrating is lack of staff/service and overpricing. Everything we did took twice the time it should of for this caliber resort-   Parking valet:  20 min. ($23 to self park even for just an hour)  Room service for coffee and 2 oatmeals (55$): 50 min Trying to get someone on the phone: 10-15 min!  Waiting in line to Check in at midnight: 25 min   I'm writing this review hoping the management reads it and thinks about makings change and adding staff, so that a fantastic experience can match the fantastic venue. I stayed here 4 nights in April for a work conference. Personally this place is just too big. It takes 30 mins to even find the front door. Service was ok, rooms were decent.. If you can find your room. The bars and restaurants were OK. If you need a taxi plan on at least 30mins to get one.. It was crazy every time we tried to leave it was an ordeal. Due to the atrium design the hotel feels humid and has a pool smell to it. Positive: clean  Negative: worse than waiting in line at Disneyland... At least there you were guaranteed a good time! Horrible directions to events - ex: ICE Made reservations over a month ago. Called the day before to confirm reservations before leaving Reno,NV. When we arrived at 3pm check in  time they told us they overbooked and couldn't accommodate us. All of our plans for first family vacation in 3 years were based on staying here. We were told \"don't yell at me , we don't have any rooms. You can go to Holiday inn\" thank you for ruining our vacation. You only care about money and you don't care about families. How can you make this right Gaylord? It's not like we can come back next weekend. I'm sooo glad we stayed at the hermitage in downtown Nashville! The Gaylord is so commercialized. They stick You for $20 here and $20 there, they even charge you to self park to tour the facility. Lots and lots of people. It's like you are in Las Vegas, minus the fun gambling. Take my advise and bypass this hotel for one of the amazing places to stay downtown. One of the most beautiful hotel I've had a pleasure to be in. The only problem is that I had to walk from the self parking to the lobby 3 times, mind you it's a long walk in a 90 degrees weather, because their parking lot exit slots were nonfunctional throughout the day. Worst thing is that after all the unacceptable experience I had to go through for an hour or so, I still had pay $25 for that parking which I used for less than an hour.   A fancy, beautiful hotel with this unbelievable poor service when it comes to parking ... Now I know where not to stay when I visit Nashville. Lots and lots of hidden fees:10$ resort fee for \"free\" wifi, water, gym and pool, 20$ to park and a 50$ hold for incidentals.. Oh and 7$ if you want to \"upgrade\" your wifi. Absolutely nothing is complimentary here.  No refrigerator, no microwave in the room, which is nothing special. At all. TINY bathroom. I would never stay here again.  Do yourself a favor--stay somewhere else and just walk through the hotel if you want to see the garden I struggle with the Gaylord Opryland Resort. If you love to vacation in Las Vegas or can't wait to go back to Disneyworld, this is the place for you! It's massive, convenient, and quite the experience. If you like adventure, neighborhoods, and the hidden gems of a city, AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. Here's why:  1) It's so fake and cheesy. There's a fake waterfall and river that wooden boats float down at all hours of the day. You can't get more cheese than that.  2) The restaurants in the \"village\" are terrible. There's a greasy pizzeria and several bars that deep fat fry everything.  Again, if you love Disneyworld, you'll love it. It's everything America is made of- it's big, it's showy, and it's entertaining. Basic conference fare with no frills. Rooms were clean, beds uncomfortable, food average and overpriced.  Don't be fooled by the resort in the name but it's just fine for a conference.  And all rooms DO NOT have views and balconies. For a Marriott based resort, I was expecting better. Rooms ok, food ok, staff ok. When comparing Nashville to other cities and conferences - it was just ok. This was by far the worst hotel experience we'd ever had.  They lost our luggage and didn't think it was a priority to look for it.  Instead they said that it will eventually show up the next day.  We spent the entire night on the phone to express our highest urgency  before they began to look for our luggage and waiting for a status.  They finally found our luggage around 11:30pm which had been misplaced by their staff.  The manager suggested accommodation for our experience and that he will contact us with updates but didn't carry through when we checked out.  We spent another hour trying to resolve our bill. This is a beautiful hotel but I will not want to stay here ever again. All we have heard is how great the Opryland Hotel is. Very nice, but when it was time for bed there was no fitted sheet on one of the beds. Following a cal to housekeeping 4 flat sheets arrived. We called housekeeping a second time where the man rudely told me to make due that they didn't have fitted sheets. I told him there was a fitted  sheet in the other bed. He said it was a mattress cover (because obviously I'm a moron. The front desk was nice when we asked but a mattress cover never arrived. For about $350.00 you'd think you could get a fitted sheet. Do not come to this God forsaken place @ Christmas. Traffic is awful. It is not worth it. Beautiful hotel.    Pros: Lots of restaurants, rooms are spacious, not far from airport  Cons: Too big and disparate Dated brickwork on inside (built in early 80's)  Check out snafu and had to go all the way back down to lobby. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. We had an exceptional guest service experience when the AC was not working in our room, they moved us to a nicer room with working AC with no questions asked. My only gripe about the hotel is the absolutely ridiculous parking fee. $29 a day as a hotel guest is just unreal.. and we come from Chicago where parking prices are pretty ridiculous. So I didn't stay at the hotel, but just came to see this famous place I had never even heard of. It was pretty with the cascades and greenery. Maybe a little over the top tacky in some ways, but nonetheless remarkable to see. $18.00 for parking sucks. Stayed 3 nights.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Well appointed room and conference facilities.  However, one does need sturdy walking shoes and a GPS unit to get around the massive floor plan.  Lots of exercise.  In the end not my kind of place, simply too artificial.  But it makes no apologies for itself and it is good at what it intends to be.  Thus the three stars. This place is huge! And beautiful. And confusing. I got lost so many times in 3 days trying to get from my room which was completely on the opposite side of the hotel from the conference center.  Room was nice and comfy. Hotel was beautiful. But the conference center was poorly designed for women's bathrooms. Always lines and smelled horrible. Food wasn't bad. Staff was helpful when they could be found but the place was so large it could be hard to find help when lost! Can we say \"massive\"?! It's just a huge place in terms of the number of rooms to the size of atrium with waterfalls and running creeks, etc. It feels like you are in a botanical garden as you enter the hotel. However, I was not too impressed with our room. It was nice, but it wasn't great. I had better rooms in less expensive business hotels. Service was good. Restaurants in the hotels were OK. Probably the best deal I had was a decent breakfast for $20 or so. Service tends to be slow since they are always busy with guests. Massive hotel+huge number of guests+limited number of restaurants=slow service. If you are here for Grand Ole Opry House, it is in a walking distance. So it makes it very convenient. There's also a decent size shopping mall with many chain restaurants. That might be a better option for meals. I just didn't love it.  Let me start by saying that I do travel for work quite a bit and I like nice hotels.  PROS: Huge and cute looking. Tons of restaurants/bars Beds were comfy  CONS: Staff didn't seem to know what they were doing at any point Hotel is a maze Breakfast was weak. Hot spots and wifi were blocked.  It is far from downtown Nashville, so just keep it in mind. Atriums are worth seeing. Other than that... Checkin horrible, restaurant staff tries but they are horribly understaffed. Rooms have banged up furniture, cheap bedding / beds and thin towels. Hotel messed up a very expensive conference sponsorship and tried to deny it. The whole valet versus self park is a nightmare. Basically made for trapped conference attendees. Relaxing now at an Indigo property (what a wonderful difference). As a Marriott platinum, I think Marriott should be embarrassed to have the Gaylord as a property. The hotel is gorgeous, clean and exciting. However, the valet misplaced our car, causing my family to wait an hour while they found it. They also would not allow for a late checkout. And by late, I mean one extra hour. They refused. The indoor pool was dirty, but the place it self was awesome! The canopies are grate and the service is good. This place is awful.  My last night here the staff shoved a \"do not disturb\" key into my door (along w/ a room key), therefore the room was left opened (for 8 hours) and uncleaned.  Staff only offered to bring me fresh towels.  Do not stay here! This place is a s*^&kicker Shangri-La. Most personnel strive to provide decent service, and facilities like restaurants are reasonably good. The problem? It's isolated in a singularly pedestrian-unfriendly place and the prices for the captives are ridiculously high for what's offered. Insult to injury is the unavailability of beer or wine at retail in such an enormous complex. They are only available at restaurants and through room service at exorbitant prices while there are innumerable 'convenience' stores in the hotel that are happy to collect $2.49 for a bottled soda. Cynical, methinks. I prefer boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, and city hotels that have unique accomodations, one good restaurant, a coffee shop and a bar. Then, an inviting area to find dining, shopping (other than the usual suspect chains at Opry Mills). It's all pretty pre-fab and dreary, I'm afraid despite the gee-whiz atrium, waterfalls, and such. I haven't stayed there but my employer has, and as the book keeper it's always a nightmare for me. Having to call and find out why the credit card bill is always higher (on one occasion by hundreds of dollars) than the bill she leaves with. Most of the time it's an error on their part but they're so hard to deal with. They don't return calls, offer either no or mis-information,  They won't accept  packages for arriving guests but will route them to the 'business center' and charge a 'handling fee'.  They don't return calls or emails. Very difficult to deal with and not polite or helpful. Check your bill - a month later I was overcharged $100 plus for room and they won't honor and credit my Credit Card. All this after I had gone to the desk before checking out and was told I had a credit coming.  I checked out then received no credit and a refusal to apply. Glad I didn't have to pay for this as I stayed here on business to attend a convention.  It's ok, kind of meh though.  Feels like they are very content to nickel, dime and generally overcharge their customers.  I mean $33 for greasy fish and chips and pint is a bit extreme.  Seems to be all about style/appearances rather than actual substance.  The saving grace were the staff that I interacted with as they were pleasant, polite and friendly.  Would I stay there on my own dime?  Nope, not a chance. Tourist trap from Hell! It's not so much the surly service as the ridiculous over- pricing that gets you.  Four hours after check-in time, your room's still not ready. Sad place, really. Unfortunately, I can't go lower than one star. Beautiful hotel and resort property with absolutely the worst service I've ever seen in my life. From arrival to checkout, the staff was either missing entirely, unwilling to help or slow and worst of all, they all had a bad attitude. It was as if everything we wanted was a huge imposition. We arrived at 1:00 on a Saturday and our room was not ready until 4:00 so we went to the Falls bar and after finally waiving down a server we ordered drinks and an appetizer. It was 55 minutes before we saw her next, when she brought out the order. No apologies, not a word then she vanished again. The next morning when we checked out, we waited 30 minutes for the valet to bring the car. Terrible terrible terrible. One star is generous. NEVER AGAIN. Before you book here be aware that they \"overbook\" the rooms and even with a confirmation number you can be very, very badly disappointed.  You might think it would be impossible to get a room with no bed at this price level and with the name \"resort\" in its title-- but you would be wrong.  The employees were so keenly aware I was being trampled upon they could not make eye contact with me and the room was \"free.\"  For what they charge in parking I could have stayed at another motel.  And maybe even had a bed.  Get ready to be ripped off and treated badly. While it is gorgeous, everything is highly overpriced, and there is no local target, cvs, etc stores for 4-5 miles away... Little tourist trap town set up around the convention center... All the restaurants inside are subpar, extremely slow, unable to handle the high volume of a CONVENTION...and extremely overpriced... Again, it's beautiful atrium and landscaping, conference rooms for convention were great and comfortable. But when you can't handle the people for mealtimes... Not helpful...half the restaurants weren't open at lunch??? The other half are way overpriced and too slow to grab a quick bite & be back on time. And stores and restaurants close 8-9 at night... Stayed at this hotel for a work convention. This hotel is HUGE! I was there for four nights and still found myself getting lost every day. Style and architecture was nice, lobby was nicely decorated. It's about a 20 min Uber ride to Broadway and the Grand Ole Opry is walking distance. The rooms were not very modern and seemed out dated. My shower had a leak and the carpet was stained with large brown marks. Bed sheets were covered with random black powder. My room had a really sweet view of the loading bag. Was not impressed with the rooms but the property was nice. It's Nashville, so I let a lot of the little things slide, but for being a highly rated hotel, I was not impressed. I'd love to write an actual review of the hotel itself but unfortunately I can't. They overbooked us despite us having reserved over 3 months in advance. They made no attempts at contacting us in advance to let us know there was an error. We were told several different conflicting stories about why we could not stay in the room we reserved.  I hope I did not miss the option for 0 stars. Magnificent grounds, but the that's just a distraction from the truth. This place gauges you at ever moment - severely over priced food and beverage. Design of valet parking a joke. Way finding is impossible. Understaffed and scheduled for random carpet replacement during Labor Day weekend, took us a 20 min detour to find our room. Sub par for sure. If you are going to Gaylord Opryland for a conference, you should seriously think about whether you need to go to that conference. As a hotel, my room very cold and dark. I called \"consider it done\" 3 times in the first 24 hours to get an additional blanket and never got it.  As a conference center, it was the most confusing, non-intuitive place I have ever been in my life. I got lost In this ridiculous monstrosity of a place every day of my 6 day stay. Even with constantly asking staff members how to get around, it was nearly impossible to find my way around. The conference center rooms were sub-artic temperatures.  The food was bland and exceptionally overpriced.  Stay away. Stay far far away.  I'm being very generous with the 2 stars...... Breakfast with Shrek, Princess Fiona and Puss n Boots!!!  Best breakfast ever!   The traffic, parking and waiting situation was dreadful.  Make sure you give yourself a minimum hour and a half for travel coming from 2 exits up.  Once we finally got on the property, we had to park so far away and there was no shuttle so we had to walk a very long way in the freezing cold.  Apparently this is normal.  Maybe they could figure out a way to make the experience better.  Once inside, there were no maps to where we need to be.  But again, breakfast with Shrek, Princess Fiona and Puss n boots with my grand daughter made it worth while. Yes, the Gaylord Opryland is impressive (especially the Delta Atrium), well maintained and has excellent staff.  The rooms are well kept, quiet and have excellent black out curtains.  However, I wouldn't pay to stay or patronize any of the Gaylord's extremely overpriced and underwhelming restaurants.  I only went to the Gaylord Opryland in the first place for a conference that my company paid for.  If you do intend to stay here, I highly recommend any restaurant outside the Gaylord.  The Cracker Barrel across the street had significantly better food in my opinion and I'm not a Cracker Barrel fan by any means.  In short, it's a very nice and expensive tourist trap. First day of a conference and the lines at restaurants are over an hour and women are 100 deep for the restrooms. Management sending people out of hotel for lunch and are saying there are two overlapping conferences that are causing the problems. Very unprofessional and we won't attend another conference held at a Gaylord facility. This is a Gaylord property and therefore is all that goes with being Gaylord - expansive views under glass with a confusing layout and lots of walking. I know some people absolutely love them - I am not one of them.   While the indoor views are nice and can work to give a cool outdoor feel, the fact is these properties tend to be overpriced, underserved and generally not a fantastic value.  there are lots of restaurants onsite- IMHO they serve moderately good or mediocre food at relatively high prices, and in some cases extraordinarily high prices. I end up At these due to  business functions- I can't say that I would book a private or personal trip to a Gaylord. They are better than a convention center- barely.   I've been to worse resorts is about the best I can say. Ahh we'll.... Landlocked. They let you into an area and then, when you try to return, they tell you that they are setting up for an event and you have to take the stairs up and down the other side to get back to your car. In between you and freedom just a few feet away are only two security and open floor (no guests, nothing). Nevermind that we have two handicapped in our party. They tell us to take the elevator in the corner but that only went to other rooms (no exit). Back again and they have us walk outside in the freezing cold and rain. The valet were sweet but the damage was done. Third world internet. Maids cannot make a bed. Nuts were on the floor. Food is $hit. What more can I say??? Place is beautiful. Front desk staff and management are unfriendly and not knowledgable enough for such a large establishment. We spoke to concierge for 30 minutes regarding details of the shuttle to downtown. Neve once did they mention we needed to purchase tickets - let alone that we needed to purchase tickets at the front desk only. When the shuttle finally arrived they explained we could not buy tickets at any other place than front desk. To add insult to injury we had went to the front desk prior to ask for directions for the shuttle pick up and was never told we would need to buy tickets from them. After wasting an hour and complaining to a manager about this frustrating matter we ended up taking a cab (and paying almost double) to get to our destination.  Most other experiences with staff and this establishment were pleasant. We're visiting the beautiful Cascade Lounge,  and couldn't get service. Husband went up to bar, waited for bartender, Gregory...who told him he couldn't serve him, he was too busy. There were no waitresses for 10 minutes. It's a holiday weekend. For a expensive resort, I'm disappointed. This place wasnt bad. The rooms are nice and cool the views are ncie as they put so much work into the hotel on the inside.  the BIG problem is they dont have enough facilities inside the hotel...  you have to wait FOR EVERYTHING, there are only a small amount of restaurants and really nothing much in the area, you will have to wait 30 minutes for a fast food burger. if you are going there for a big convention i feel for you, im sure if its not a busy time you will be fine. Nice clean rooms, amazing gardens and atriums, and good service.... But tell me again why we paid almost $30 for two frozen yogurts and a bottled water?! Overpriced food and drinks. I don't understand how the price can fluctuate that much when you could drive within a couple mile radius to get the same product for a fraction of the cost. This place will cost you 30 dollars just to park. My lunch at Sports Bar was 120.00 dollars. The food was marginal at best. The service was excellent. However the food is lacking. I didn't stay here and I'm actually glad of this. I came to Nashville just after hurricane Irma hit in Florida.  This was a coincidence. I had a conference at this hotel booked months prior. I'm happy they had no availability when I tried to book a room because the service at this hotel is tepid at BEST. I spent each day here and had multiple meals in various restaurants on the property. Staff pretty much overall acts as if you are an inconvenience. Prices are high with mediocre quality. I suppose I'm spoiled by the gaylord Orlando but I felt like this hotel was VERY low quality by their standards. They pack this place with so many people you can't even walk around to enjoy that the grounds are nice.  Forget about getting into restaurants or even talking with the front desk, it won't happen without a 20 minute wait. Clearly, they have not staffed accordingly and people that are working are scrambling. We have waited to get into everything, including just using the bathroom in the front lobby area. Trams to parking that cost $20 were not running and my father that needs assistance walking didn't not receive help even after we called 3 times. Do not waste your money here. There are plenty of ways to enjoy the city without this nightmare. Horrific, in a word.   My room was clean. Bed was fine. That's about all I've got.   This is a terribly laid out, horrible place. The food is shockingly appallingly bad. Every restaurant. It's almost a marvel how bad every restaurant is.   Just don't. Stayed at this hotel for the Hobson u conference. To say the service is deplorable is an understatement. Went to Jack daniels for dinner and was seated and then ignored, while other people who were seating after house were ordering food and we still didn't have waters. Ended up walking out. Went to get pizza at watersedge and the cashier walked away as soon as we got in line to pay for our food. Next day spent $6 on an Americano made by an unimpressive rude barista named Poppy, who at one point told her co-worker no when asked to do something. After lunch went to get a cookie and while I was clearly standing in line at the register in the gelato shop, the cashier helps the person behind me first. Unbelievable. Cannot wait to leave. All food is served at room temperature. Grinds are nice for an indoor mall, but rooms are lacking. But the food-yuk!!! We came for a Christmas getaway. While the hotel and Christmas atmosphere was nice, the check in process took over an hour. We were given an upgrade from our suite and were excited as we carried our luggage about 5 miles through a maze of endless hallway after hallway to a room roughly the size of a walk in closet with a breath taking view of a service parking lot and shed. After we found our way back to the lobby I was told the closet we were given as a room was much better than the suite with an atrium view that I had reserved. They did give us the room that I had originally booked and our stay has been nice since. Crowds are amazingly large and as in most places, common courtesy is a rarity. All in all... not a bad little getaway. Visitors Beware: Our flight was cancelled so my husband and I decided to visit the hotel and check it out for our next trip to Nashville. Their parking is not well explained. It looked like 20 minutes free and then $5 per hour. We enjoyed waking around and when we left 26 minutes later they charged us $26! Ridiculous. We won't be staying there in the future. Lots of options in Nashville that don't do business like this. They need clearer signage and a reasonable parking fee. This place was beautiful inside and fun to walk around. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants but just walked through all the gardens. The biggest disappointment was that this is listed on all the \"free things to do in Nashville\"  lists but parking is $30!!! We parked at the mall and had to walk quite a ways for it to be free. We were not going to pay $30 just to park for an hr and walk around. Other than that, this place was a decent thing to do to kill some time Beautiful facilities but, they will bump you or conveniently loose your reservation if they can fill your room for a dollar more.  Standing in line to check in, which took 20 minutes, i overheard three people  go through this situation.  Then they did to me.  I stay an average  of 50 nights per year at Marriott hotels, and I will avoid staying here if at all possible in the future.  This same situation happened to several people in our group the last time I stayed here as well. We stayed three nights here. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The lobby can be busy at times but when it's not, you can really take in its beauty. While there seems to be a lot to do here, one walk through and my curiosity was satisfied.  There are numerous restaurants to satisfy whatever you're craving. Sushi. Steak. Tacos. Pizza. Salad. Beer. Wine. Tennessee Whiskey. We dined at 2 restaurants over the course of our stay, but we found yummier items outside of the resort.  Our room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Concierge is great for helping you get downtown. Purchase tickets in groups of 4 or more and they are only $10. Don't have 4 in your group? No problem. Buy with 2 other people in line waiting to buy tix... make friends, save money.  The resort is surely beautiful. Well kept and welcoming. Everything is way over priced, first the food is triple priced and not very good we tried two spots and that was enough ,everywhere u go they want 7 dollars for a beer,the parking is 25 dollars a night another ripoff,so if your common folks stay across the street and eat at the cracker barrel,if going downtown stay closer to there this place is for people who want to waste there money!!! And that's the truth Is bedbugs one word or two? You'll need to be familiar with those little guys if you stay here. I vehemently recommend you find somewhere else to bring your family unless you're in the market for new pests (and those nasty bites) to bring home as souvenirs. Sure the place is beautiful but they treat everyone like we are walking ATM machines and endless supplying piggy banks. The staff doesn't care about the people or our experience (and they make that painfully aware), they all just look for the next opportunity to get the cash out of your pockets. They built this place as somewhere you don't have to leave for the duration of your trip but make it impossible to afford to be in there. This place is great for being at a conference when the company pays for everything but aside from that, it isn't worth the money. Stay somewhere else and MAYBE (you'll be totally fine if you never see this place, I promise) make a small trip to walk through... bring your wallet though because no one will help you unless you have cash taped to your forehead. Nice property with possibilities. Staff is where it breaks down. A lack of training is evident from the honors registration to the concierge. No real effort to focus on the customer. Be prepared to know which atrium best meets your preference.   Restaurants weren't much better. Staff had a routine for seating which meant we were dircted to a table in nowhereland even though the restaurant had just opened and there  wasn't a  crowd. As a resort there should be more focus on understanding and helping the customer enjoy the very nice facility. Unless you like over-priced fakery, avoid at all costs. One plus is you get your walking in, since it is so huge. The convention facilities were good but it's a bad trade-off, in my view. You are so far removed from anything authentic, and have to make an effort to get fresh air. If you want a little piece of real Nashville, don't stay here. $25 cab ride downtown, one way. Always a beautiful place to stay!! Bellman was nice and explanatory about the room and amenities. Room was very comfortable. When we called to checkout, the lady at the front desk advised that in order to obtain the valet'd car, I was advised they had plenty of staff and just take the ticket outside. Upon arrival outside at the desk, we were advised we needed to go inside to a different desk. The interesting part was that there were half a dozen workers standing 3 feet from us hanging out and talking as I walked in to retrieve my own keys (picture attached). That killed the $400 per night charge plus $30 valet parking fee for me. I would prefer to stay downtown closer to Broadway and the concert venues there. If you like shopping however the Opry Mills Mall is next door to the Gaylord. Great shopping and restaurants. Horrific service particularly as it relates to housekeeping.  Rude staff.  Most of the facilities are nice but very little to do.  Overall a disappointing experience.  Will not return. This place is rather epic. Be ready to pay for it. The guest room that I got was not particularly nice, although there were also no real issues. the conference facilities are vast, and well-managed. consider this a 3.5 star review. This hotel/resort reminded me of las vegas without the gambling, and night clubs.  It is huge and literally took me about 15 minutes to get to my room from the lobby.  While it seems like there is a lot going on, there is not much worth doing in the place.  The restaurants are not great and the shopping was not impressive.  You can do a riverboat ride inside the hotel which seemed kind of pointless. The rooms were clean, spacious and nice.  They give you a free water bottle which was a huge plus.  Hate when they charge you 5 dollars for water at other hotels.  The staff was friendly.  The check out process was quick.  Really appreciated the express check out option.  The place is quite pricey and may not really be worth it. This place is huge!  The scenery inside is absolutely fantastic. I was impressed with the man-made river and all the live plants. They even have a neat boat ride.  My hotel room was in the delta section and it was alright; however, the AC had a very, very hard time trying to keep the room cool enough. At night I have a hard time sleeping unless I can get the temp to about 70 degrees or close to it. The AC could barely do 74 which is actually pretty warm considering the high humidity.  The AC unit, by my guess, is limited to certain temperatures as I tried to let it run all day and all night to no avail.  Otherwise, though, the staff is great and very friendly. The food inside the hotel varies from not that great to pretty good. Pricey in every sense of the word, parking $20 day, rooms starting at $175 and ranging upwards of $2-3K I'm certain. But other than that, the place is amazing. Huge, well maintained indoor gardens, boat rides, waterfalls, etc... It's a must see when visiting the city. Just once. Room was old and worn.  Carpet stained badly.  Thermostat didn't work.  Bed very uncomfortable.  Shower head sprayed in all directions at the same time.  Nice view of giant garbage crusher. ;)  Too expensive despite the nice atriums.  Food way too expensive.  Extra charges for parking, internet, and even more for fast internet.  You will do a lot of walking and easy to get turned around.  Best for convention stay, but not for a one or two night business stay.  You can do much better at one of the nearby hotels.  I probably will not stay here again. Yall the place has so much potential. But the vomit (yes vomit ) rags that were left in our *check in* clean room were enough to gross me out, until our daughter noticed diarrhea splatter on the not so cleaned toilet. Literally 5 hours later, after notifying management. And we are still waiting on housekeeping to rectify.. opryland you could be amazing but you never are, and at 400$ a night this is unacceptable. huuuuuge!!  worth staying there a few nights with a significant other. too bad most of the restaurants there have poor reviews on yelp. No denying that this place has charm and is gorgeous. I just have major beef with the over priced parking, the food service that ends at midnight and the fact that after you have already spent an arm and leg, they can't even offer a continental breakfast.  I paid $80 for the Fiddler's Inn across the street and they had complimentary breakfast so don't tell me this place can't swing it. They wouldn't even bring Advil to the room for my friend who was suffering from a headache. They told her that rather than spare a couple pills to a guest, she could go pay top dollar for it in the gift shop. Save your money unless this is just a super special getaway. Meh. Grand and very large, but high prices and far from town. Beautiful conservatory gardens. Depressing and expensive food. Rooms are large and well appointed. Stayed here for a work conference and was disappointed with our experience. Several of my colleagues were given rooms that were dirty, already had people in them, or they were checked out for no reason. My room was spacious and had all of the basic amenities but had a very loud ac that I was not able to adjust. I probably would not return to this hotel during a personal stay in Nashville I'm starting with a 2 star because the front desk people are rude and the place is nasty in the magnolia wing.  in fact they put me in a shit hole.  at least i got moved to a decent wing - delta - and found my secret little bar there that was not crowded.  btw - that gave this review a 2. We didn't stay at the hotel but went to see the Lorrie Morgan Holiday Show.  Very disappointed!  The food in the ballroom was terrible-cardboard chicken and very poor service.  One guy at our table wanted a glass of wine and he had to buy the whole bottle!  The show was a disappointment as well.  Entertainers that are no longer 30 need to accept the fact and dress appropriately.  Lorrie is still a lovely woman but she is 56 and no longer should be wearing frilly ball gowns that show off her cleavage and back.  Just saying... This place is HUGE and the only reason I can think to stay here is because you're attending a conference.  Seriously, it makes no sense to vacation at a place like this because you could stay inside all day and really it wouldn't matter what town you're in.  Rooms were fine and comfortable.  If you do have to be stuck at a conference for a week, it's nice to feel like you're outside, I guess.   There are a ton of restaurants on sight.  Mexican cantina was decent, and the Library is a great place for cocktails. This place is utterly heinous! It is an atrocious behemoth that possesses neither style nor taste. The food is grotesque and and over-priced, and the service is is non-existent. I considered drowning myself in the foul-smelling, man-made creek before deciding to stay elsewhere. I would rather have a colonoscopy with a garden hose than visit that ghastly place again. Horrible customer service! Made reservations months ago with a group from work. They bumped us to different hotels when we went to check in. Separated our group! I ended up moving to 3 different hotels in 4 nights! Their solution was to offer me free taxi vouchers! my room no better than a good Holiday Inn.   18.00 for a fancy egg mcmuffin and Sorry we don't have home fries  but we serve them at Lunch ??.   Your paying for the gardens  very nice but that's it.  Last time I got coned was at Atlantis Hotel  same  holiday inn room instead of plants I paid for the fish tank.   suggested by several to stay at Hampton Inn across and take a walk over  cause they charge 24.00 for self parking.   Beautiful Gardens but not worth the price of staying or eating there. We were pressed for time before heading to the Opry.  Got a slice of pizza at the buffet style Italian restaurant. The pizza was nothing impressive but you couldn't miss the layer of dust on the glass above the food.  Had I not been so hungry I would not have stayed. There weren't any other quick easy options for a bite to eat. I booked a hotel room for 2 people in a double occupancy room... Instead what I got when I checked in was an atrium room with no real beds. Worst part is I'm an elite marriott member and the worst accommodation/problem solving to meet any reasonable needs. One of us forced to sleep on a pull out and the other on a couch. Awesome job marriott and I'll make sure that my negative experience is heard across the globe. Worst experience, worst customer service, might as well be a motel 6.  #marriott #gaylord opryland #customer service #discrimination #negative net promoter #manipulation #trending #pissedoffconsumer #ripoff #gettingscrewed #integrity #loyalty #rewards #18007217033 Horrible experience. If want no customer service and like standing in line come here. When I made the reservation, I was quoted a price that I agreed to. Then, the resort tried to charge me a mandatory \"resort fee\" that they didn't mention to me. I will dispute the credit card charge - that's deceptive and illegal. A cross between a nursing home and an airport. All the charm of a Walmart garden department. $20 per day to park (more than per day charge to rent my car).  lots of sidewalks that end suddenly --not bicycle or outdoor pedestrian friendly.  Nashville is awesome! Loved 'The Grand Old Opry'! People are the best!  Save yourself a bundle of cash and stay somewhere else. Nowhere near what I was expecting plus several other downsides. The first thing I noticed was the mold in the vents in the hallways. There were no towel rods or vent in the bathroom. The room itself smelled wet and musty even after airing it out a bit. No one vacuumed our room any of the days we were there or at least it did not look like it. The hotel layout and parking lot especially are very poor in design and access. The workers or cleaning staff were very noisy late at night and early in the morning (we were situated just above a restaurant.) 3 years ago had to come here for a work meeting and ended up lost and confused in the bowels of the hotel. I tripped on stairs and ended up in the ER. And my work is having another meeting here this week. I leave tomorrow and I'm dreading being back at this hotel so reminiscent of the movie the shining. Beautiful beyond words BUT Very expensive for the type of room you get plus they didn't even clean it. I just settled for extra towels. $18 \"resort fee\" !  For wifi and 2 FREE waters. Whoopee !  Parking $30 per night !!The food was unbelievably high at every restaurant here. Breakfast was $15 for 1 small yogurt and 2 coffees !! After 2 days of feeling ripped off that was it. Never again. Wow.  This place is huge! We went here for the day while visiting family to get out of the heat since we had a newborn baby with us. The inside atmosphere of this hotel is incredible. Took the boat tour first to get a history in the place. Was really expensive $10/person for a 10 minute boat ride, but it did let us see the entire hotel quickly. Wish the rooms were more reasonably price so we could enjoy it for a weekend. What I would pay here for 2 night I could rent a condo in Florida for. Opryland hotel I believe we all agree that is a beautiful place. We also had a wonderfull theme park that they closed in 1998 & replaced with the the Opry  Mills maul . We no longer have the Opryland amusement park but the  Opryland hotel still kept the name. There is no longer an Opryland and it seems out of place for the hotel to keep the same  name. Incredibly noisy due to the numerous amount of people walking through the hallways because of the setup of the hotel. Couldn't get any decent sleep or rest. Beautiful Atrium. Would never stay overnight again. Room was hot, humid, & smelled also could hear construction early in the morning. And the parking was horrible! Paid $29 a day and my room key was never activated to let me in and out even after notifying front desk and the third party parking service twice. I think maybe they just don't have enough staff to follow through on their jobs. I'm so disappointed. Our room was fabulous. Definitely five stars. Valet parking took 45 minutes at drop off and 20 minutes at pick up, with what seemed like lots of standing around and disorganization. We were disappointed to find that Jack Daniels and Findleys were the only locations within the property to have live music (on a Saturday night). Both of those locations are quite small. No matter how good the atriums are, it's no use if we are supposed to wait for more than an hour to just get our rooms, worst experience The interior looks nice and so as the bed. The rate per night it pricey and it's not worth it. I'd you want to stay here, I'll warn thou to bring your own soap, toothpaste,  slippers, etc. Beware also of dirty bed sheets(we had ours changed when we got there) . They don't even have complimentary tooth paste, toothbrush,slippers, etc.  Only shampoo, conditioner, lotion , shower gel and soap good for one person. The room we got on the first night was facing exterior view and oh boy, it was so noisy because of the construction going on so I requested for a change of room. Good thing they transferred us.  Argh.  Honestly, I expected a great service but I doubt I'll recommend it to my friends unless they change. Very gimmicky. Reminded me of a worse version of Disney mixed with San Antone's Riverwalk. Basically a big mall with extra pretty fountains. Very nice outside with the plants and water falls. It was big , took many nice pictures. The people that work there were all so helpful -always giving directions and friendly.  Now the bad parts- a lot of hidden cost on bill.  Room had stained carpet and dirty glasses. The room was very out dated, from the outside I thought this will look really fancy inside the room. (Not)  We got there on January 2nd and stayed for several days, thinking we would not need a car with like ten places to eat at.  Wrong- they closed all the places to eat except two places, because of low attendance after Christmas. They should of dropped the price then on the rooms, the restaurants were way over priced and selection of dishes was not good . This was not worth what they charge to stay . Gorgeous, plant-packed atria:  +***** Balcony overlooking the main gorgeous plant-packed atrium:  +***** Room:  +*** Location:  +* Pillows:  -***** Food (we knew better, but were there for work, & thus somewhat trapped):  -*****  So... yeah. OK, but not a place to stay on your own time or dime. It's for people who are either tradeshowing it up, or haven't figured out how to mine Yelp to find nicer, more centrally located digs.  And if you decide not to heed my review and eat here anyway, just to rub salt in your wounds, here's a link to Holland House's menu - one of the many highly reviewed eateries a 15-20 min cab ride away - so you can see what you could have actually enjoyed eating for $10 less/plate: http://www.hollandhousebarandrefuge.com/menus/ Boo boo boo boooo... ;P My family & I are on vacation. We took a boat tour of the Opryland Resort. An absolutely astonishing place. The price for the tour was fairly inexpensive, an the tour was fun for all. Very disappointed in the 21% tax rate for 3 glasses of wine. What's the deal with that? Was not that high at other establishments. Waitress muttered something about it being the \"Bible Belt.\" Bianca the night manager literally said: \"overbooking is good revenue management\"... Someone needs to put that in a book of things people in the hospitality industry should never say!  Bianca,  dear... Your job is to provide exceptional client management.  Tonight you get a fail.  The Gaylords as a whole are cesspool.  Poor customer service and a stain on the Marriott family but this night takes the cake!  (note to managers reading this...I did 142 room nights last year) Customer service was terrible and extremely slow, stayed 1 night and it was extremely confusing and over crowded. Waited an hour for our car at and their excuse was sometimes the phone system doesn't work but we talked to a real person. Check in was just as terrible and unfriendly, for the cost it is no where near worth it the room was the same caliber I could get at motel 6. I was there for a professional convention.  It was horrible.  There is zero customer service.  The blow dryer in the room was from 1987 and did not blow hot air.  The air conditioning system is also outdated.  The ice machine didn't work on many floors.  It was very large and I had trouble navigating, but if they had friendly, knowledgeable customer service agents easily accessible, it wouldn't have been a problem.  When we got to the check-in line, there was maybe two agents there.  1300 people were registered for the conference. I've had to call a couple of times and when they couldn't help me, they just asked me to call back (not taking my name and number and offering to return my call).  This is supposed to be a swanky hotel, but my experience was unpleasant. They need an overall customer service training session ASAP. massive and creepy.  Creepy because it is a maze and its hard to find an exit, and when you finally escape you are surrounded by acres of parking lot, a big mall, and NOTHING else.  So you're trapped in this convention center hell with lame, expensive gimmicky restaurants.  All the plants and water are a spectacle, and you get over it after 3 minutes. I can't think of one thing good to say about this hotel. Check in, maid service, valet parking, check out, restaurant service, were all awful. Over priced, dirty, run down rooms. Can get same quality food at most restaurants in Nashville and surrounding areas. Why spend the money here when you have new Convention Center and surrounding hotels are cleaner and nicer!  Be back after they replace the carpets, broken furniture, and other broken trim in rooms. Around Christmastime, this hotel really is something to see! Beautiful! Their attention to detail is amazing. Their \"Christmas Show\" starring Lorrie Morgan; however; is a total flop! The worst show ever! The food was good, she on the other hand was not good. I thought all of us should have received a refund! The show itself is not good and she acted like she was really something. I'm surprised Opryland allows this sub par show to continue. Maybe they haven't seen the show? It's really humid in there. Weird in a humid state they would try to lock in the humidity. Shops are overpriced. But customer service is great I'll give it two stars & that's s good stretch. Went here for a conference this week, not impressed. They put me in a room w/ a \"pullout bed\" from a coach because 160 rooms needed to be maintained. Barley compensated me. Very over priced. Restaurants were not that good either. Find else where for the money. Not good. Service sub par. Amenities below average for what they claim to be. Don't valet your car! Beautiful atriums.  Not sure it's worth paying to stay there. Have to take paid transportation into city.   I would have stayed in town and visited the Gaylord. Oprayland hotel.  Seeing it once is enough. Rooms on the exterior are ordinary and if you want to stay in a room with a balcony overlooking the atriums is an additional $50 a night. They also charge a resort fee of $20 a day and a $35 shuttle fee. Lyft and Uber are more economical ways to get back and forth into town. Allergy sufferers beware. Plants, plants, plants. My review has no reflection on the grand scale and beauty of the resort. I'm miserable. Beautiful if you're just walking around, but everything is overpriced, spaced too far apart, and the furnishings are cheap for what you pay. The restaurants and bars feature mediocre food and high prices, its best to find your meals off-site is possible. You'll pay extra for parking, extra for internet, and pretty much everything else while here.   Beautiful gardens. I had to attend a customers manager's convention held here. This place is huge and very hard to find where you need to go. this would be the last place I would hold any kind of a function. No directions, over-priced and hard to get around. The food service at any place other than the sit-down restaurants is appalling.  Unless you have your own car, you are trapped - as a visitor - and have limited options to obtain takeaway food (coffee/sandwich).    The \"Marketplace\" in the Delta area is always understaffed and inefficiently run - resulting in long customer lines.  It's curious that management hasn't ascertained that they with a little internal reorganization (not hiring more staff), they could easily reduce the long lines and actually make more money.  At the Cascades Conservatory - I bought a bagel that was inedible - it was toasted (even tho i didn't ask for it to be toasted) and hard as a rock - it must have been 3 days old at least. My friend and I came here for a quick drink after our tour of the Grand Old Opry. This place is Disneyland-meets-Marriott, which is a compliment.   The center jungle/waterfall/courtyard was nice to walk around in, but after 20 minutes there wasn't much more to do.   If you're in the area it's definitely worth popping in for a lemonade or something (the pizza looked suspect though, beware), but I wouldn't make a special trip for it. This place is so big...don't get lost.  Paisano's sucks - don't bother going. Stax was pretty good, and I liked the concept of building your own burger.  I didn't stay in the hotel so I can't say anything. Caution - This is not your typical Marriott hotel.  Awful first time visitor experience.  We arrived to 35 people standing in line with only two service people at the front desk to assist.  Not what I expect when I'm paying $300/night.  When I finally make it to the front of the line and checking in, I get no apology for the wait, rather, I'm reminded of the $28 valet fee per night, $18 resort fee per night.  What a poor approach to creating a wow for the customer.  Too bad.  Won't be back.  Stayed at the Hampton Inn near Vanderbilt prior two days and had a great room, nearly twice the size, breakfast in the morning, no parking fee and all for half the price of the Gaylord Opryland \"Resort\".  Trust me, this isn't a  vacation spot if you are looking for one.  The experience just isn't worth money. Just found some dirty clothes in the dresser and a half eaten chocolate cake in my room fridge, which btw doesn't work. So disgusting. I heard a lot about this place before coming so I had some higher expectations, but none have been met so far. The floral carpets are outdated, the labyrinth of pathways are confusing, every single restaurant is poorly rated, and I feel like I can't escape. Just getting to the gym will take me about 8 minutes, so imagine going for a walk outside.   The rooms are super dusty, there is an unpleasant odor, and the water pressure is weak. The only thing acceptable so far is the bed. It seems fairly comfortable so far. I wish I didn't have to stay here, but I'm stuck for an entire week. Overpriced, not enough staff, half the elevators were out and no safety with little kids in pools or hot tub, don't come here to relax! Also the shuttle drivers are rude, booked one room to get stuck with 3 people in a king, they give you a twin, but no pillow and it takes hours to get a towel or anywhere with staff using the few working elevators, God forbid there be a fire, because there are not enough stairs. Nice rooms but the venue is poor at assuring that restaurants are equipped to handle the number of guests. We attended a conference and everywhere we went was an hour wait although there were empty tables. Some restaurants were closed.  Extremely poor planning for a conference center. Will not attend future conferences if this is the destination. We booked an atrium view several months ago for a special occasion and we are looking at the side of a building.  See attached picture for our view. If they put you behind a shed that should not qualify as an atrium view in my opinion. I went here for a conference and it is quite the hotel. This hotel is so big that they give you a map to your room. The rooms are also a good size with a good view. This hotel has everything that you need in it with plenty of of restaurants and stores, and the outlet mall is very close.  The negatives to this place are the cost. The rooms are costly for ~200/day and the hotel to airport shuttle cost ~30/roundtrip. Other hotels have a free shuttle to their hotel. I definitely would not have paid this much if it was my own money, but since it was for a conference and I didn't have to foot my own money... this hotel was okay :) TERRIBLE SERVICE! I've traveled the world and this was one of the worst experiences in my life. We arrived at 3:30 pm and were not in our room until 7 pm, including a half-hour wait in line at reception, ruining our dinner plans and the entire evening. Most of the management staff were rude and/or ineffective. Long walk to get anywhere in the hotel. Mediocre restaurants. Located in the middle of nowhere about 20 minutes from downtown Nashville. We were staying here because of a convention but I'll never return for business or pleasure. My partner hated it even more than I did. Husbands birthday surprise was a total flop. Obviously this hotel is only interested in the masses than personal service. When I called for reservations they promised me the moon. Whe n we arrived their was no king sized room with a waterfall view as promised. And we got a room with a double and view of roofs. Also no basket of chocolate truffles otdered and supposed to waiting in the room.this hotel makes promises, b ut doesn't deliver. By the way we arrived at 3:30 5:30. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, just be prepared to pay extra for everything. We went to the new Soundwaves water park in the hotel and paid for a room and 4 wristbands for about $500. If you want a locker in the water park it's $15. If you park your car it's $29 (valet is $40). We were here in January 1st and went to the Solario Cantina for dinner. The menu looked good online, but when we got there, they were only offering a buffet (the hostess told me it's because they were so busy during the holidays it got people out fasterSo we decided to take the shuttle they offered to the mall which runs until 9 pm, but they failed to mention after we had already boarded the bus that the mall closed at 6 and we we dropped off to locked doors. If you do not mind rude staff and a six o'clock check in because they are hours and hours late to getting your room cleaned then this is the hotel for you! And the crispy pork tacos at the Mexican restaurant are more like thrice digested tacos.  Avid this hell hole at all cost!!! Beautiful gardens and lights but didn't really like the rest of the place.  With all the great food you have in Nashville it was not reflected at all in this hotel.  There was no where to get a good breakfast and the restaurants that were in the complex were closed sometimes due to private parties    The resort is far away from downtown Nashville with its great music scene and wonderful restaurants and bars.   They have a bus to take you downtown but it's 20 dollars a day and runs only one time per hour.   It is next door to the new grand old Opry and a mall (didn't like the vibe or choice of mall stores).  I would not stay there again This place is outrageous. Went to see the holiday lights and decorations, which are beautiful, but you'll find ourself weaving in and out of people and children. The hotel is HUGE and keeps going and going. I felt like I was in Charlie and the Chocolate factory. Cool to visit for the experience but not a place I'd want to stay or eat. First, the place is beautiful. And clean. But the service is HORRIBLE. Absolutely HORRIBLE. Everything is a ridiculous wait (45-min to check in! Room still not ready when stated). Want to eat? Good luck...it's a 1-2 hour wait for everything. Zero logic and horrible management on basically all fronts. Again, kudos for cleanliness and design, but the service experience was the WORST ever. We honestly received better service at Americas Best Value hotel which looked like it was in a horror movie. Oh, and the signage is awful...I mean good luck finding ANYTHING...and the cost for parking (which you are not told about when booking) is also ridiculous. #super disappointed overall The customer service is that of a one star hotel.  Nice day for the Music city bowl and New Year's eve was less than spectacular. I'm highly disappointed.  Do not use their shuttle service or concierge an hour and 45 minute wait for the shuttle in the bitter cold is just unacceptable. The resort is great! So why 2 stars? I specifically asked the Gentlemen at check-in for a decent view . My words\" I don't need spectacular but please give me a decent view. Just don't give me garbage cans\"      Yep, you got it. Garbage cans . If I knew how to attach a picture , I would . I can't believe this guy . I was nice , friendly with a simple request on such a big property. Wow . It is seriously over looking garbage cans. Thanks . Very disappointed in this place and only been here one night. Checkin was a problem with our rate. Mattress had to be swapped out because of a big whole in the middle and woke up with a terrible backache, had to readjust the shower curtain ( housekeeping's job !!), one bar of soap between two sinks and the shower. Just a lot of vacation time wasted on things that we shouldn't have to. STAY AWAY!!! Horrible cleaning staff! My daughter's jewelry went \"missing\" yet the maid turned the cup upside down and left her retainers! The pony tail hold was even under the turned over glass, like the maid was trying to make it look like a clean glass. I filed a report and was told \"there's nothing we can do!\"  Seriously???  Fire your housekeeping staff! I took pictures of it.  Empty toilet paper rolls not replaced, empty tissue box not replaced. One day we received no towels, another day 5, then 3, then 4! I've never been this disappointed with a Marriott chain! Super expensive with airport prices on everything.  Food places are disgusting,  especially the Starbucks. $24 for two coffees, breakfast sandwich and kind bar. The Soundwaves place was nice, super humid in there though. Beautiful Vegas-like hotel...would've rather have saved the money though. Most of the stores/ restaurants closed at night time. If you're here for a conference it's \"OK\".  Gets old FAST though.  Decent service.  Place is MONstrously huge.  You'll get lost easily.    Essentially it's a giant terrarium.  Quite cool inside in the middle of the summer.  Can't imagine the A/C bill!  Rooms are beautiful but not cheap. 6 nights never changed the sheets. Restaurant locations were mostly rude we took our dining dollars of site after Fuse told us there was a 45-50 wait with a half empty restaurant and dozens of tables open. Delta was closed to pedestrian traffic today due to \"decorating\". Large hotel that is unique, rooms facing Delta or Cascades are loud due to restaurants, music and people traffic. $29 a day parking is very high. Many of my peer conference attendees felt the same about all of the previous issues. Hotel is impressive, but food staff and housekeeping are not. This place has a potential to be better than an average 3 star rating if only they had friendlier employees and better management. While checking in, I asked for a room with a king bed..they said the king rooms were not clean. I said ok I will stick with double bed . I came up to room and it was not clean and the person from before was so gross. I called and they said they would send housekeeping but after an hour still no housekeeping. So- no first impression not good. But new linen for me. That is upside. So I just tell you to check in later after dinner to make sure you get a clean room. Oh no mad at cleaning staff. They don't have enough hires to keep up with the turn over- that is a management issue. Absolutely don't stay here if your not here for a work event. Every bar and restaurant is closed for a private event. If your are not apart of some convention, you have to Leave the resort to eat and drink. Then to make things worse, they apparently find it acceptable to pressure wash at 3am. I've been to so many convention centers, but this place is one of the most spectacular ones. They have garden, gondora, waterfall...it's a jungle out there!   My problem with this place is the shortage of parking space. Either you park veeeeeeery far and walk miles, or you park at the next door mall and walk.  Second, because the place is such a maze I can never find where I came from. I'm sure there's apps for that, but I don't. And feels like I can never find the people working there, unless I'm lucky enough to find the front desk (after miles of walking) or cafe (after more miles of walking)   The hotel is very nice, great view and great service. Make sure you book for the room with terrace, so you can grab a drink outside and watch the water at night. $100 hotel service, $250 a night price  Nothing was bad about the room, but nothing was remotely memorable. Ground floor facing the outside of the hotel with a view of a chain link fence situated at the very far side of the complex from my convention.    Made the mistake of taking the airport shuttle. Shuttle was late leaving the hotel, bellhops/valets were unorganized, taxis were scarce, and the loading area was loud and crowded. It took me 45 minutes to leave after checking out. If you have to go there, do yourself a favor and use Uber. Way to expensive, dated rooms with no coffee. Everything costs extra (parking, internet, coffee, water, resort fee ect ect. food was bad. First time I have ever seen sushi cut into unequal sized square chunks.....CHUNKS! plus everything is a 20 min walk away. You wont find one person that isn't staring at the map trying to figure out how to get the hell out of this place. Oh and don't put your room key next to your cell phone, credit cards or car key or according to the front desk it wont work. Really??? where exactly then am i going to put it??? I was very disappointed in this hotel.  They nickeled and dimed us for everything.  After we got stuck in Nashville for two extra days because of the hurricane they charged us extra to keep the rooms we had instead of giving us other rooms.  this was in a hotel with lots of empty rooms The staff was nice.  But I would not stay there again Internet is horrible, even with the \"upgrade\". The hotel is nice inside.  The rooms are so-so.  The restaurants have really gone downhill since the flood. Altho this is a beautiful hotel with nice staff it could use a major updating in the elevator department and everything is over priced. What bothers me the most was the lack of music entertainment! Being Nashville you would think the night life would have more music! Most bands that were playing should of persuade a different line of work! It's like being in a maze every time you leave your room. Every person we spoke to was complaining about being lost and confused. We were excited about the Mexican Buffet and was willing to pay $21 per person and wait an hour to be seated until we went through the buffet. The food was not fresh, the queso was cold and there wasn't much of a selection. Parking was $20 per day, $6 scoop of ice cream, $5 cup of coffee... I could go on and on!!! Over rated!! On a positive note, the atriums were beautiful and the house keepers were super nice, pizza was comparable to New York pizza. The first time staying here and I can't wait to leave this place it's beautiful don't get me wrong but you can not get service the screams at night was ridiculous when you walk you have kids screaming adults screaming at the kids then they run into you. The toilet was nasty when we came in and the shower i waited in line to get help with the waterpark only for him to brush me off. We tried to eat sit down after waiting 45 min to wait another hour and 15 min for no one to even wait on us so we had to go elsewhere and since we waited so long we had no food, behind on schedule and no one even noticed or cared. This place is understaffed needless to say. DO NOT RISK RUINING YOUR VACATION BY PLANNING TO STAY HERE!!!!  They overbook the rooms and then randomly cancel reservations without telling you until you try to check in. Doesn't matter if you booked months in advance or put down a deposit. Your confirmation number is worthless here. This happened not only to us but friends we were meeting there (who had made their own reservations), and it could happen to you. This is a unique place as many other reviews have described. I Stayed one night en route to Atlanta with three teenagers. My take away is this:  the atriums are stunning; the place is crazy big; the food prices are outrageous; and, It is criminal to charge hotel guests $21 for parking.  My kids enjoyed the pool and exploring the enormous atriums.  I considered staying downtown or near Vanderbilt university and I wished I had.  The room was nice, clean and as expected for a typical Marriott but nothing more. The room was reasonably priced but everything else is extremely overpriced. The parking fee is particularly galling. So parked there just to go and pick up some information for a convention that I would be attending.  Parked in self parking, spent 30 mins getting what I needed.  Was charged $29.  Was told that anything over 20 mins was charged for a full day.  Workers were courteous, site was clean, and the place is massive in size.   Outrageous in the greed and disappointed a resort would have such a short time parking policy.  Disneyland, Universal City, no resort I've ever went to has such a policy Nash Vegas if thats what you looking for. The place is OK.. but not worth what they charging for. Is Vegas wannabe. If you want a Fakey Touristy spot go to Las Vegas you can get nicer hotel rooms and better restaurants at same or less price. All i can say is Vegas Wannabe. We just went to see the Christmas lights,  was a nice place,  but cost us $29 to park and there was 2 car loads of us.  Think we would have enjoyed just driving around looking at people's decorated houses. Called GOH Reservations to book our rooms for the Family Reunion in June.  VERY HELPFUL Agent named Jennifer!  She was very thorough in giving me information that would prove helpful to prepare for our visit(being a former Hospitality Professional, this is a real sensitive spot for me)....I really felt like she was interested in ensuring my family's needs would be met.  She even gave me a personal reference for a local pet boarder, as the hotel does not accept pets(boo to GOH for that policy).  So far so good GOH....let's see how things go in June!    update to come! This is an absolute tourist trap. $39 for valet parking plus tips every time you want your car. If you self park it is $29 daily and a really long walk.  The three restaurants that we tried were very over priced and not good. Would not recommend this place. If you want to take a shuttle anyplace it costs at least $20 per person depending on where you want to go.  Will probably come back to Nashville but never again to this place. This is a Must See place... extremely overpriced $400+/night for an average room not overlooking the atrium. The Atriums are beautiful! A lot of shops and restaurants. It's $30+/day to park, if you are visiting, park over at the mall and walk over. Absolutely beautiful inside though. If in Nashville, find a cheaper room and just take a cab over to see the place Beautiful venues made visually appealing at Christmas season. However, better to include time to view as a visitor rather than a guest. Should not be identified as a resort, given the lack of real amenities for guests. No real reason to pay for an unremarkable room with lousy pillows. No price breaks on shows, events or dining for guests. Fitness facility has adequate machines, but no classes (yoga, Pilates, jazzercise, square dance, etc.,) offered. We went downtown for \"fun\", where there was live music & affordable meals. In retrospect, wish we had stayed downtown but glad we saw it. This ginormous hotel is quite possibly the tackiest place I've ever been. I feel like I'm trapped in the biosphere with no connection to the outside world (is it warm outside? cold?). Staying here all week (covering the baseball winter meetings), I feel like I've been transported to an alternate universe where everyone is old, walks with rolling suitcases and enjoys snapping photos of faux waterfalls and hanging zebras dressed in xmas ornaments. My salvation is Rusty's Sports Bar and the Jack Daniels Saloon, both located in the \"Lounge Wing\" of the hotel. This hotel couldn't be much bigger (it has its own zip, apparently) but it all looks exactly the same. Who designed this place? And do I really want to know? I wasn't entirely impressed considering the high price you pay.  The beds were broken down and horrible.  The place is very huge and it requires a lot of walking to get anywhere.  It's easy to get lost in here.  The restrooms are far and few between to be found within the facility.  Overall it was a huge disappointment!  You have to pay to park your car plus pay a resort fee...  It's a rip off... We didn't stay there, just wandered over after going to see the Grand Old Opry.  It looks expensive but OMG, huge is the best way to describe it.  They have 2700 rooms plus some suites and inside there is a waterfall, you can take a boat ride around the little river, restaurants and shops.  Web were going to eat there but the places we wanted to try were so far away that we gave up.  I'm guessing if you wanted to have a convention, this would be the place.   It's listed as one of the places in Nashville to see and it is just from the wow factor We checked in at 1 pm and we had requested a double queen bed bedroom. We have 3 kids under 6 and really needed that extra bed......they didn't have that type of room available and suggested we get a king bed bedroom and 2 roller beds for the kids. At 11 pm, 11 hours after checking in, we still didn't have our roller beds.....my son fell asleep on the bed and my daughters  on the strollers. We finally received the roller beds at 11:45 pm......NOT a kid friendly place.  There isn't an excuse to not have a roller bed ready after 11 hours......not to mention that my toddler's crib didn't make it to the room either! We need that bald guy on TV to come to this hotel.  Where do i begin... the front desk, needs improvement, cleaning crew same, and the beds here are old and you feel the lumps from other people in the past. Cascades American Cafe worst breakfast I've ever had nasty nasty food. DO NOT eat here not worth the money they charge or even up to the status of the Gaylord they can't even use fresh vegetables in there omelets. They used really gross pickled peppers and such. My first time to stay here and I don't think I'll be back. All staff were great, but I was really underwhelmed by the room( king- outside view). The restaurants were also, meh... They do have a waterpark on site, but I don't want or need that attraction at my hotel. If you're there for a conference then it's probably great, but for a long weekend get away then other Nashville hotels would be better. Sorry Gaylord Opryland, you're just ... meh..and I'm not looking for meh... Now I understand the low ratings. The people were friendly, grounds were beautiful and beds comfy. What ranks it low and makes it so frustrating is lack of staff/service and overpricing. Everything we did took twice the time it should of for this caliber resort-   Parking valet:  20 min. ($23 to self park even for just an hour)  Room service for coffee and 2 oatmeals (55$): 50 min Trying to get someone on the phone: 10-15 min!  Waiting in line to Check in at midnight: 25 min   I'm writing this review hoping the management reads it and thinks about makings change and adding staff. If the service was up to par the costs wouldn't seem so ridiculous. So far,  very under impressed with this property.  Here for a conference.  Try to order room service at 9pm and told it will be at least an hour wait.   Worst part is when I talked to the manager was told that they are NOT understaffed.  This means they plan on service this poor. You expect more for $300/ night. This is a convenient place for the Grand Ole Opry and the staff is kind but simply not my kind of place. Nothing is natural and the all man made features along with no fresh air, at all anywhere, leaves me feeling like I want to get out. Better for a dinner out.  Example: Called night before check out to ask if there would be bell men on duty at 4 am and was assured oh yes they would have them. But oh no, no one answered after multiple calls so we were left lugging our (lots) baggage quite a ways to lobby.  So it depends on what you are looking for. If a mall is your idea of fun  you will love this place. Some cute shops and Ravello Restaurant was lovely. Had visitors from out of town who wanted to see the beautiful conservatory at Opryland Hotel. We opted to park at the hotel even though the cost was $24!! However be advised that they charge TAX on parking there!! So our $24 parking pass cost us over $26!!!  Outrageous!! The hotel was nice but they look like they employ illegals. We came across several housekeepers who could speak no English.  Outrageous!! Worst customer service ever. Arrived at 3 pm to check in. Waited 20 minutes in line, only to be told that our 3 rooms were not ready yet. On multiple occasions we contacted the hotel (after making reservation in February) to request rooms near one another because we were traveling as a family. It was noted in our record we were told. At 5pm, we were told 2 rooms were ready on opposite ends of the enormous floor. After more phone calls, finally our third room was available at 9pm!!!  Not once did anyone apologize or offer to make reparations for our inconvenience. In fact, they blamed us for needing rooms close together. So disappointed, will not EVER stay here again. Drove over to Opryland to meet some friends in town for lunch at Cascades.  Good service and food, though the sushi rolls are small (better to go to Nama locally for good sushi).   Good experience, until departure.  The young man who was our valet parking attendant (Devon?  or something like that) was absolutely rude.  Tipped him, but shouldn't have.  Jerk. The place is huge, its definitely a nice place to stay. Problem is everything is way over priced. You really don't get enough for your buck. $26 dollar breakfast? Or 23 dollar plate of eggs bacon biscuit? There's always lines for everything so you take it cause it's usually what's available or you can get greasy greasy pizza for 5 bucks. The waiters and waitresses are amazing though! The parking getting in and out is RIDICULOUS, our room keys didn't work the entire time, and by the looks of the lines to leave the lot, seems like others didn't work either. You'd think with how much is being spent there that could atleast be fixed.  Overall 3 out of 5 for the experience. No.  Being in this place makes me feel like Hunter S. Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  Bad craziness.  Has a kind of unsettling Branson, Missouri meets Vegas meets Dollywood vibe.  Cool, all these bars!  But they close at 10.  What?  Cool, a parking lot the size of 30 football fields!  But they charge you 20 bucks a night.  Everything here is pretty expensive and not that great.    They get a star because my 12 year old daughter loved the pools and the waterfalls, etc.  Hot tub was pleasant. I stayed here for an event.  Staying at this hotel is like staying at a theme park, except all the staff is rude to you.  Slowest check in I've ever experienced, and the check in staff was very snotty.  No one seemed to know what they were doing here and seemed to get angry over reasonable questions (\"What is this random charge on my bill for?\")  And the place is unbelievably expensive.  I mean seriously, I got charged $3 for a cup of tea here (a small hot water and a teabag). All the food was overpriced and just not good.  I'm giving it two stars because there was nothing actively bad and the room was fine, but nothing was really good either. The hotel is gorgeous but you need to be prepared for a lot of walking in this very large hotel. If you are staying in one of the far wings it may take you awhile to get to the front desk if needed. Waaaaay too large and more of an amusement park than an actual hotel. Due to the size, the service and convenience fall to the wayside. Would not choose to stay here again. Slightly overpriced but beautiful! The kids absolutely loved our double sweet room overlooking the gardens so that they could run about the hotel freely. The pools were under construction and the one remaining pool was overly crowded. Check in was a nightmare and the charges for parking were terrible. However, this iconic hotel is a great place to stay and really is very fun. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean, and the service in the hotel is pretty good. Be prepared for a long wait time on getting your car if you park valet and a long walk to your car if you don't. Resturaunts in the hotel were good. Overall great place to stay for a Nashville trip! 30 minute wait to check in was not a good first impression. Then we got a king for 3 people. It gets worse....Waited 30 minutes for a new room assignment when they said 10 minutes.  New room was nice. Whole facility is spotlessly clean.   Restaurants are good, but a little pricy.   Pool areas are popular for families. Great food. In some places. WiFi at night is not the best. But other wise pretty good. I If you offered shuttles or carts regularly to help people get around this place would be so much better. Got to our room and had a big flat screen LCD box in the middle on the room which took 3 hours to move. Shower water pressure was very low and temperature was very hard to control. Paid for a Garden View Balcony and got a Steakhouse Restaurant View with partial view of brown dried up palm leaves.    The grounds upkeep was lacking throughout the resort. Many trees and plants were brown and water fountains had black mold.  Had dinner at the Jack Daniels Restaurant, the baby back ribs were hard, burnt and seemed like they had been cooked days before and warmed up. For a room the cost us $350-$450 the experience did NOT meet our expectations.  We won't be back to any of these resorts. Beautiful but over priced, the nickel and dime you at every turn. Restaurants on site have slow service with mediocre food at prices that make NYC look cheap. Internet connection is painfully slow. Was here for a convention which was convenient but not worth the hassle. The hotel itself is awesome.  So much to do.  We have stayed here multiple times throughout the years. Before it was a five star review.  Friendly service, great amenities, and atmosphere.  The reason now for the three stars is housekeeping has gone downhill bad!  We come into our \"cleaned\" room to dried blood on the side of the bathtub, Cheetos on the ground underneath the bathroom vanity, a dirty shower curtain, etc.  thank goodness for Clorox wipes and Lysol as they are sold out.  I attached a photo of what came up on the Clorox wipe from doing a few swipes on the bathroom floor, where you would step after being freshly bathed. Seriously a zoo and huge ass rip off $32 for self parking. EVERYTHING costs a \"you are our hostage\" fee. Just awful. In dire need of new management and a process improvement team. Beautiful atrium and property but registration is a nightmare. Everyone acts on their own, undoing what others have done and telling you very different stories about what and why. If it weren't so frustrating it would have been comedic. And while it dampened our family's get together, we weren't alone. Many hotel guest were sharing similar stories. Expect to spend multiple hours standing in line to register. Certainly not up to the Marriott brand. They refer to it as a spa property but much more zoo like -definitely not relaxing. So I'm up in my room boolin with my boys just chopping it up ya know and we wanted some room service at around 3am and they said they don't do it this late which is crazy. Paying out the ass for a hotel room and I can't even get some room service. This upset me greatly. The only positive experience was my boy or girl Corey at the valet. All I wanted was a bacon egg and cheese. Horrible organization!!!! They did not tell me there was two valet first 3 days walked miles to and from the front valet. They messed up reservations on my second room. No maid service at all for 2nd room. Valet text to bring car up did not work. Calling front desk takes 1/2 hour. Room was nice property was nice. The employees just did not know what they are doing. Gigantic hotel.  Daughter enjoyed water park.  No automatic upgrade for Ambassador Elite.  But what really disappointed me was the fact that I left something in the room and I called the hotel within 30 minutes of leaving for the airport.  I told them exactly where the item was.  Instead of going straight up and getting it before housekeeping could go in, they just ignored my request.  Of course, I call back the next day and they said housekeeping didn't find anything.  Had to pay $100 to replace my item. That's extremely poor service and really just laziness.  Not impressed. Worst hotel ever! The layout is so confusing that the staff can't even figure out how to direct properly. They have THE LOUDEST waterfall in the atrium so if your room faces that direction, don't expect to sleep. If your room isn't facing the atrium, it faces the highway so again... don't expect sleep here.  Just checked in to my room and it is dusty & moldy smelling and the chest of drawers is broken.  They also have very limited vegetarian options for food. All around, awful awful hotel. Total dump! Extremely overrated and overpriced! You are paying for a name! This place is confusing to navigate and the employees at the restaurants were kind of rude. The room was not bad but for the price I paid it could have been better. The spa is overrated as well. We stayed at the Gaylord Nashville for my daughter's birthday. The timing was right after Christmas...you know...right when you have a bunch of extra cash. Well when we got in the staff was sorta helpful but not what I would have expected from a 5 star hotel. If you can't rival Chik-fil-A hospitality then you aren't a 5 star resort. I had a hole in my towel with stains when I got to the room so I decided to drown myself in food. It was $20 for a hamburger so I had to eat my $10 dollar bill instead. I enjoyed the Christmas lights. Very disappointed. The atriums are nice but that's it. Rude, uninterested, disorganized front desk staff. Waited 40 minutes to check in. The front desk agent said nothing to us during check in, not even hello. Got the room. Out dated, holes in walls, dirty fixtures. (Motel 6?) Laying on the bed and the latticework on the window just fell on the floor. Thankfully no one was under it. Hampton inn is across the street with better parking and better rooms. Stay there and just go to the Gaylord to see the atriums. Upgrading from 2 to 3 stars after management contacted me in response to a Trip Advisor review.  They offered to refund my resort fee and offered what seemed to be sincere apologies.  I am still disappointed at the experience, but am impressed by the follow-up. FYI... until Sept...50% of the resort is closed.  Nice vacation spot for families. Food should be priced more reasonably to help balance out what you  spend on your accommodations.  Waterpark shuts down often for 30 minutes to  2 hours based on if lightening strikes and during the summer this is several times daily! We didn't get much time at the soundwave waterpark. While the hotel grounds are beautiful, the experience was terrible.  Check in was supposed to be at 4 but our one room was never ready until 5:15.  We complained because we were going to miss our dinner reservations before the Grand Ole Opry. Management said they would get our bags from check in and we could change in the bathroom.  . At 5:45 our second room was ready.  Management did give us $75 off the first night. The hotel nickel and dimes you for everything.  To take a boat ride through the hotel was $50 for 3 of us, 3 hamburgers, one fry, and 2 drinks was over $30. Parking is far away and the rooms are tiny.  We stayed at the Hilton downtown Nashville for about the same price and it was a better value.  I couldn't wait to stay at this hotel and we were definitely disappointed. After a wonderful Christmas celebration at our son's home, we stayed the night at Gaylord Opryland before driving home.  The property is lovely and we looked forward to staying here to enjoy the facility and the decorations.  Shortly after 7 AM on December 26, we were rudely awakened by the noise of trucks, hammers and workers shouting! Our room was located directly beside an ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION SITE!!!!  Is this the reason for the \"resort fee\" charge???   This hotel is massive so why was our room literally on top of the construction site for a new water park? Why weren't we told that when we checked in????   I can't describe how disappointed we were!!   BEWARE if you stay here!!! I really expected more from the  resort. Waited 4 hours for our room to be  ready. We were supposed to be texted once the room was available, that never happened. When we finally got into our room, we found a half full bottle of water and hair on the bathroom floor. When I requested to speak to a manager, I was told he was out to lunch. I asked to be contacted once he returned and that never happened. Now that I've been here, I can tell you this place sucks. Not only do they block your phones hotspot (wifi ). they are extremely over priced. If you've been to one Gaylord you've been to them all.. just like the Mills mall that sits beside it. they are all the same . do yourself a favor and find a good hotel downtown. The inside where all the shops are and everything are nice. However everything is way overpriced. I went in to go get mucinex since I was sick. In the resort, mucinex was 28 dollars and some odd cents. Which was ridiculous. I went to a drug store and got mucinex and tissues for 11 and some cents. Ridiculous. Then we stayed at the resort. I wouldn't stay there again. The refrigerator never worked and it spoiled out food. They didn't care since they had food there. May I add, a bowl of oatmeal was 11 dollars and sides were 7 dollars each. The bathroom reeked. There was no fan in it. Front desk wasn't all that great. They would talk to you like you were dumb. Absolute worst experience of my professional career. My company does an event every year in a fifteen city. We were excited about Nashville because of the draw.   We have 1100 room for 10 nights.   The service is terrible. The selection is pathetic. And it's 11:30pm and to top it off we have four adults talking in our suite and security just told us if we don't make our guest leave we have to leave.   I will never EVER stay at another Gaylord property.  Do not even consider a Gaylord property If you do corporate events. They over promise and under deliver. Worst. They charge 15% Tax.  I asked the waiter and he said there are two taxes. The state tax and the resort Tax.    What a croc of s..t.      Ask about it when u book  When I bought just a drink a full 25% was added to my bill for Tax.     I think this is very underhanded and dishonest Thieves!   Jesus Christ are you sure you don't want to check my pockets for spare change? I have never been squeezed at every opportunity to this degree in my life. This is thievery, pure and simple and should be banned. To the people who own/operate this shithole: there's a special place in hell for you.  Oh and wtf is up with the closed pool?!  Room service decent bottle of wine and a banana pudding = $100. No bullshit.   Also why is booze taxed at like 25%?!   Thieves! This place was gigantic but unbelievably expensive.  Glass of wine and California rolls - $30, Burger and a beer $19 and it just goes on and on.  If I wasn't here for a conference I would not have stayed here.  Rooms were nice enough but did not have a coffee maker in them, which sucked for me.  Also, it's quite a ways from the sites and events in downtown.  Should I return for a vacation, I would choose a location closer to downtown.  I would, though, bring my wife around to show her the behemoth that is the Gaylord Opryland. Their focus is the events which were fun but do not go expecting a good hotel experience. Takes 20+ minutes to get anyone on the phone from your room. They do not have courtesy books in the room to give more details about events or restaurants/menus, maps and nothing about room service. They do not have a concierge. We checked out a day early from frustration and went to a 4 star hotel downtown which charged less per night. When my husband went to express his frustrations at the front desk, they did not care we were checking out early. It was as if it was a common occurrence and they were used to it. Go for the events but stay somewhere else. Tip: if you are not staying at the hotel and just want to walk around and experience it (like my boyfriend and I did) DO NOT park on the grounds... Parking is $25! My boyfriend and I parked in the hotel/restaurant parking lot across the street for free. About an 8 minute walk to get to the entrance... Definitely worth saving the money. The hotel was nice, but I would have been upset if I had spent $25 just to walk around...  Also, across the street is the Dukes of Hazard museum (free admission)! Customer service is very bad, the follow up is bad also. I have been trying to get a wedding quote for two months now. I spoke with two different sales people who have yet to call me back. I call and spoke with a manager two weeks ago who apologized and told me she will personally have someone give me a call.  I called her back a week later again she apologized and promised she would get a price for me. I am writing because I have still not heard back from anyone. Not the characteristics of a five star resort! Very dissatisfied, and disappointed. Called Reservations to make two room arrangements. After almost falling asleep listening to recordings about their Starwood security screw-up, loyalty awards, Marriott award points and then by their request to make a review about their reservation experience, I was FINALLY connected to their reservations person. I had to repeat myself twice to a person that barely spoke English. She couldn't understand my request for two rooms and I asked to speak to her sales manager. After waiting 12 minutes in which no one answered that line, I hung up. This is not the first time I have had a bad experience with this hotel. No wonder people rate this hotel with bad reviews. One thing is for sure, I will not make the mistake of trying to stay at this hotel again. This hotel is absolutely horrible! Don't waste your time or money staying here. $250+ per night for a Murphy bed. Heat stopped working on the coldest day in Nashville and guest services takes 2 hours to address the issue. Hotel staff is ZERO help with any issues you may have. This is NOT the Nashville you know, knew or is. Hopefully, NOT what Nashville is becoming. To sum it up in one word: CONFUSING. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. And then they argue when it's brought to their attention. Overall...it's still a nice place...but it's more of a 2 star hotel when it comes to basics. My advice? Stay in the local hotels and then hop over to take pics if you want pretty pics. Nashville has so much to offer, and this \"new\" Opryland puts a bad face on this wonderful city. This place is so freakin' huge and opulent.  Sure, it's cool that it's like being in a tropical wonderland inside a glass bubble...but it's not worth the expense.  The rooms are average.  The food is overpriced.   The service, however, is 5 stars.  It seriously, seriously is top notch.    And there's recycling, which is why this is a 3-star review and not 2. Terrible. My family and I stayed here last week and were very disappointed. We made a reservation 2 months in advance but when we arrived at 6pm we were told my parents' room wasn't ready yet. Check in starts at 4 and the room still isn't ready? They reserved a king room but we were told that it wouldn't be ready until 7:30 so they took a double queen room. Parking is $32 but complimentary for hotel guests. You are \"supposed\" to be able to hold your hotel key up to the reader so the gate opens but none of our 4 keys worked. We had to call for assistance every time we left and wait for them to open the gate to avoid paying $32 every time. The hotel is crowded, tacky, and a waste of money. I will stay downtown for any future trips to Nashville Visited back in December 2010, had an overall good experience. The resort is great- very clean, updated rooms, comfortable beds, good gym and spa, friendly/helpful staff, my room had a great view of all the 'A Country Christmas' stuff which was plus!   Only complaint is the lack of variety in food establishments it's mostly sit-down restaurants w/ wait time of ~35-60mins (lunch/dinner time), being that I was there for a work conference and there were several conferences taking place as well this made lunch time a hassle. The stars say it. Its a 2-star hotel for a 4-star price. The environs are nice with the plants and water falls but the rooms are small with cheap amenities: coffee and coffee maker, soaps and lotion. Food we ate at Findleys and Paisanos was good but overpriced. Biggest irritation was self-parking. Half the parking key cards didn't work leaving lines of guests trying to get out and ONE parking attendant. Contacting the hotel brought no response. We were going to a concert at grand Ole Opry (new one) so stayed for convenience. First and last time. If you like getting lost in a giant hotel and paying to much for convention food then you fond the right place.  Slow Internet and restaurants that are not open everyday.  If you are here to attend a trade show stay down town and pay the 20 bucks to park your car at least you can enjoy Nashville Once again this resort is not able to handle a huge conference. Inadequate food, beverage stops along the way. Yogurt shop open 2-9pm is one small example. Lines 20-30 people long to go to restroom and get coffee. No places to get snacks in between a ten hour conference day. Restaurants when open, are good, yet when the resort is full good luck eating on the run. Food trucks, pop-up vendors would be awesome. To say that this much anticipated stay was a disappointment would be a HUGE understatement.  When I think Gaylord, I think elegance, I think great customer service, I think excellent restaurant choices, I think lush bedding/towels, I think friendly, happy service.  My husband and I found NONE of this.  Your staff (other than the gentleman who checked us in) was awful!  We did not come across one friendly employee/staff member.  Your restaurant selection is poor, way overpriced with very unfriendly staff and mediocre at best food!  The entire facility was FREEZING cold and smelled like chlorine.  The Gaylord is dated and in need of renovations.  The only bright spot was that the plants/trees/lighting is beautiful and that it is so convenient to Opryland... that's it.  ONCE AND DONE!!!!!!!!!!!  Expected much more.  Marriott should be questioning their investment. The hotel itself is beautiful! The spa is great and there are a ton of options for restaurants and bars. The rooms are very basic. You would expect much more when you see the lobby. My main frustration was there needs to be more staff available to help people get to and from. The hotel is huge. Everyone walks around lost. It could of been a 4 or 5 star stay if I wasn't so stressed about finding where I was trying to go. There should really be a sign saying how much parking is. We wouldn't have stopped! We were here to check out the hotel's Christmas decorations (not all out yet). Only here an hour. $32 to park. Ouch! Totally taking advantage of people! Very unhappy with this resort. I stayed here for a military army event and left some very expensive items in the hotel room. I reported them missing an hour after I checked out and security got back to me that nothing was in the room two days later. Then they got back to me that there was no record of me reporting the items missing. I filed a police report and never heard anything back. It was over $400 worth of items passed down to me and I am appalled. Nothing like this has ever happened at a hotel usually they are honest. Especially at a military event. Don't stay here it's a rip off and they're thieves. Not bad- overall it's HUGE like a little city. Reminds me of the Bellagio in Vegas. There is a lot to do here and  a host of choices for food. Stayed for three nights and didn't leave the property except to go to Publix and the mall.   Food is pricy and drinks even more but if you don't want to head off site - it's tolerable.   My bed was sub-par and squeaky. Bathroom nice and overall the room was updated. There was a small fridge and coffee maker in the room. My room was a standard and nothing special.   Of course there are coffee shops and little stores and you can get whatever you need. Gelato and yogurt onsite as well.   Would I purposefully stay again? Probably not- too big for me. I like small, quaint and personal. This was not the case.   Ok hotel but probably won't be back. Housekeeping experience here at Gaylord Resort stole food from our room. Management basically told us we were lying and offered a cup of coffee to appease us. Nope.  Just nope.  Don't care how nice it is-- the pricing is super deceptive.  Booked this resort on Priceline thinking it was a good deal -- SURPRISE, it's $50 more thanks to $26 parking (whhaat??  it's not even downtown, there is plenty of parking) and a $20 resort fee (not optional).  That's ridiculous.  If you need to charge that much, bake it into the room price. Facilities are lovely. Everything was gorgeous. However, extremely pricey. Charging $24 to self park each night, a $19 resort fee per night and $50 per night for incidentals (so if your staying 2 nights they will charge you $100) was outlandish. I expect an incidental charge on a stay but not per night. Rooms were expensive! Great place to get some cool pictures for you're on vacation. I would rate it 3.5 stars only because of the guest parking areas and the parking areas in general. The parking was all $35 or above. The guest parking was far away from the door and any other time I wouldn't mention it but a family member has a fractured knee cap and it would be a long walk for any handicapped person. We didn't stay because we were visiting all over Nashville and didn't need a resort. Also the guest parking lot was free parking but was very very very dirty and full of liter. There was a pair of underwear a full gallon of oj in the middle of the road and just plane trash everywhere It's so sad that such a beautiful spot is run by misogynistic staff. The Mexican restaurant bartender named \"Kiki\" was totally overwhelmed by her job and could barely keep the bar tidy much less serve drinks.  We waited for 2 hours for our food to be served by the bar.  After that time we inquired about the delay and Kiki called security claiming that she did not feel comfortable serving us.  The manager refused to hear the women in our party and would only speak to the men.  We are so disappointed with this place and advise everyone against coming here.  In today's day and age, this place is a relic and managed by discriminatory staff who don't believe in treating their customers well  After two hours, we walked out without dinner.   Never coming back. Fees... Yes the place is awesome. It looks amazing. It's as good as anything Disney has. A boat ride and an area that looks like New Orleans. But when I was sold a nightly price of $169, then paid $252, I'm trying to figure out how over eighty dollars in fees is possible. Well it's beautiful regardless. Beautiful atmosphere! Requires a lot of walking so be prepared!! I would stay here again if it's the off season. If you like to surround yourself with large crowds of tourists and convention attendees amongst a greenhouse of plants and fake waterways, and enjoy the mystery of trying to locate your hotel room amongst the thousands of rooms and passageways, then you might actually enjoy this place.  It wasn't my cup of tea.  The rooms were on the smaller side but were actually fairly sound proof. Could not hear any of the ambient noise from the atrium. Mediocre rooms, the worst food I've ever had (how do you mess up a Caesar salad!?) and the whole massive property shuts down at midnight. Want room service or a bag of chips at 12:05 -- not so much as a vending machine. Even basic amenities like in-room coffee or the hair dryer were cheap and generic. The place needs a massive renovation.  The atriums were pretty but the pools were hideous. The place is impossible to navigate because the signage sucks and not a single person who works there can tell you how to get to another part of the hotel.  I came for a convention but if I'd paid for my stay myself, I'd be furious. In reality though, I never would have booked this place. It's clearly for conventions, old people and families with no taste. I thought it was very nice. Beautiful inside. Just gorgeous. Lots of nice restaurants. However, I found the rooms to be a bit pricey, and the hotel itself too big. It's huge! My girlfriend and I got lost so many times over the four days of staying there. Lost trying to find our room, or maneuver our way around the premises. My next problem is the room we stayed in, we could hear every passerby in the hallway. We did not use the pools or the water park, because we spent our days sightseeing all around Nashville. But the hotel is very beautiful I will say. I was underwhelmed by the opryland resort. The way some people talk about it you would think you should definitely see it while youre in Nashville,  but it's just a large hotel. Unless you have to stay here for a conference or work related event I wouldn't. Aside from the grand ole opry there isn't much to do here, and it isn't close to downtown Nashville. Wow. Giant tourist trap.  Stay down town and party. Restaurants are so so 2-3 stars tops.  Odd so many servers are from another country being where it is.  Rooms are small and feel really old even though it's not that old.  The gardens are amazing.  If your going to the opry good for a night. It's a beautiful hotel. But getting nickel'd and dime'd to death after spending $300 on a room gets tiresome.   $29/day for parking is excessive by at least $10 $20/day resort fee on our final bill?  Be honest with your pricing and include the resort fee in your rate.   You can park in the attached mall lot and save $29. We wish we did. Worse experience for a nice hotel ever.  I'll not stay here again and will not recommend to others.  Rooms are nice but couldn't get tickets to water park, all pools were closed even though it was a holiday weekend, and we couldn't get in to anyplace to eat even though we called ahead and asked.  Horrible customer service. This place is the worst marriott I have ever stayed in, and I am a Platinum member. Total rip off every-time you turn around. It should not be called resort, because there is nothing to do. Only one or two of the restaurants are open each night and they are all atrociously overpriced. And they charge you 20$ per person for a shuttle to go into town. 25$ a day in parking, and 4$ for a coffee. Its like a bad joke. Trust me look elsewhere. Id rather be at the courtyard. At least there I can get a reasonable breakfast for under 20$. Also there is a reason why every restaurant and bar in here has 3 stars or below. I even called to register a complaint and the manager basically laughed at me. Place is pretty but very artificial. We love the tropics and all the flowers but all we smelled was chlorine when we walked thru the atrium. Just not our style. Shocking. Lifetime titanium member. Who cares?  Everyone is treated like dirt at this property. Many restaurants, overblown number of people staying here. Constant conventions, Nashville is so popular now, etc. whatever. This is the WORST service you will receive at any Marriott property anywhere. Seriously. It's an embarrassment for them and they don't seem to care. Never again. Overpriced. Not worth all the extra fees over and above room rate. Parking fees, resort fees, delivery fees, wi-if fee in conference, fees fees and more fees. Not nice enough for cost. Restaurant food is NOT worth the cost. Stay closer to Nashville, better food and more convenient. Beautiful to walk around in, and just massive.  Parking can be a hassle (and $20) but still a fun place to bring folks from out of town to visit.  Eating in side is quite pricey, but fun for a special occasion. We were here this past weekend for the cheer competition. The whole resort was under staffed for a event this large. The room was average and the facet in the bathroom leaked. The price for a night is not worth it. Getting food was a nightmare. Parking was $32.00 a day which is ridiculous. After attempting every restaurant possible the resort had to offer and was told that the wait is over 2 hours we ended up ordering room service. For 3 burgers (which was way over cooked) it was $89.00. I would not want to stay in this hotel again. When you know you have a large event taking place, you staff your business appropriately. Waited in line over an hour to check in. The quality of the food does not justify the cost. Never again will I stay here. Huge disappointment for this being a Marriott. This place is huge with a lot to see. We didn't stay here, but I would like to in the future. The rooms looked nice. We walked around and took the boat ride. The boat ride wasn't worth $10, but it made a few in the group happy to do it. They had all the lights up for the holidays already. It was very pretty on the inside. The place offered shopping and restaurants. Unless I plan on booking a hotel room there, I probably won't be back for a while. In my opinion, it's good to see it once. I was here during Christmas time and they really do a nice job of adding a lot of holiday fun, decorations and add in Santa being available for kids.  This is a nice space and I really found it far more pleasant than the Gaylord Resort at National Harbor I had recently visited prior to this one.  This is also located at the famous Grand Ole Oprey and right next to a large shopping mall (pro tip: you can park at the mall for free then take a free shuttle bus to the Convention Center).  This is a very large space with a great deal to see so make sure to schedule a pretty large chunk of time to fully explore this space.  The convention center is also very nice and this is one of the best places to attend a conference that I've ever experienced. So the hotel is pretty great, and the whole area has so many amenities and has such a nice warm emulated outside environment. It's great. I could go on forever on what there is to do and explore in here.  Yet I still cant get over the literal 45 minute wait I had to CHECK IN. This isn't acceptable in the slightest, ever.  Also, the hot water, or lack thereof, was terrible. It kept going on and off.  And there is a non-negotiable 20 dollar resort fee? Gotta love hidden fees. The grounds of the resort truly make the stay. Several pool and restaurant options are available. They also have a large convention space for meetings. The rooms are well appointed and I had a nice balcony overlooking the Cascades area. My number one complaint, and I have stayed a resorts before, is the pricing. Can you imagine needing a razor and it is $18.99? For a disposable Venus? 300% markup! Wow, good thing I didn't cut myself. I might have needed another $20 for band-aids. Overpriced ...  plenty of nice places to stay other than here. Stay downtown is my advice... more entertainment and everything is within walking distance If you go to Nashville and spend all your time at Gaylord Opryland Resort, then you may as well have gotten a hotel room in your hometown for a staycation.   Pros: 1. It is beautiful inside with all of the real, and lush plantlife. 2. It is clean  Cons: 1. It is a tourist trap- you will experience SO much more of what Nashville has to offer by staying closer to downtown 2. The signage was TERRIBLE. We got lost every. single. time we left our room. It was overwhelming and very frustrating. 3. There are no fans in the bathrooms. Every female's nightmare. 4. All of the restaurants are EXPENSIVE and very disappointing. Nashville has so much good food...this resort just did not live up to the city's standards.  Save your money, and stay elsewhere. Stayed here a couple days ago with my family. If you're not into droves of people everywhere probably not the place to stay during Christmas. We had to wait in line for everything and not a couple minutes, at least an hour. Parking is a nightmare. Cost us 20$ for a lot at least 1/2 mile away and then we were trying to find a closer lot, but all we found was a 27$ lot even further. Check in took an hour and half. Everything is over priced.  Nicely decorated for Christmas though. We stayed once and That's enough for us. BEWARE!!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO LEAVE HOME WITH BED BUGS, BITES, AND MEDICAL BILLS.  The hotel took no responsibility for taking care of the situation. We alerted them about the severe, inflamed bug bites covering my friend's arms only after the first night. The manager pretended to look shocked as if this is a common occurrence. There was absolutely NO sense of urgency in examining the room or even MOVING US to another room. This place is a COMPLETE joke. They do not care about your well-being AT ALL. This place is a complete hell hole. I have no idea why anyone would come here unless trapped at a convention like I am. Rooms are so-so unless you need a balcony to look at the man made atriums. All and I mean all of the restaurants are mediocre. The food and the drinks are not exciting and below standard   $14 for vodka on the rocks which again looks like a thimble. The wait staff is hit or miss. They say there are pools but I am not walking all over to find them. If you are coming to Nashville why wouldn't you actually stay in Nashville. Except for a convention I would never ever stay at this hotel. Pretty & massive, it's easy to get lost & everything is overpriced. While it seemed fun for many guests, my room had a strong chemical smell because they had recently refinished the bathtub. There were many renovations going on so there was an odd odor during my whole stay.  I was there for work, so I'm not sure of the costs of the room. It was ornate & just not my taste. However the pool looked like fun & the beds were super comfortable.  I wouldn't turn down another opportunity to stay there, but if I were paying I would be more critical. We spent the weekend at the resort while attending a conference. While the gardens were simply amazing, the rooms themselves were somewhat subpar and front desk staff were downright rude and unprofessional. This shouldn't happen at any resort. During the weekend we had the chance to try several of the restaurants inside the resort and they were fantastic but very expensive. The best that we found was a simple pizzeria in the delta atrium that we couldn't figure out why it was closed for three of four lunchtimes over the period of the weekend.  Kids loved the pools but found little to do for families except the gardens and pools. We watched several movies in the room or had to travel off site for attractions. Just a brutal experience. You are in the middle of nowhere. Unless you don't want to leave the property and pay crazy prices for everything...you're stuck.  WiFi is a pathetic joke. If you are paying 300 bucks a night. Yes, one overpriced meal; 20 dollars parking a night; and gas to get to anything off property and you are there. That much and you want me to pay for better WiFi? Ridiculous. This place sucks!!!!! Nothing but problems since we got here, be prepared to wait for more than 20 minutes when calling the front desk. Tried to order room service only to be told that they were busy and it was an inconvenience for them to bring us food. The place is a maze and has very little considering how big it is and how much it's advertised. The entire center of the place is closed right now for a conference and only a few restaurants are open but all have more than an hour wait. Trying to get any where else in Nashville is at least a 20 minute drive. I will never again waste over $300 a night here, Renaissance and Omni are way better choices! If I could give 0 stars, or negative stars, I would. Went to the \"I love Christmas movies\" exhibit and it was the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life. It's like they went into their attic and found anything they could to charge $30 per person to make an \"experience\". Half of the things didn't work, the employees were embarrassed to be working there, and you stand in line for 2 hours before experiencing this laughable atrocity. Don't waste your time or money. Whoever was the producer of this show, aka the dumpster fire of the worst middle school Christmas paegent you've ever seen, should be fired. Do not buy tickets to this dumpster fire. The Gaylord Opryland is pretty nice. Nothing great. They nickel and dime you but that is no surprise for a resort. They lack clear signage upon arrival. It's a bit of a drive to the Nashville nightlife and prime activities. Overall it's a decent place but I was unimpressed for the price. I'd recommend staying downtown in the city for the same price Stay at Marriott hotels all over...so had to try this one in Nashville. Check out ice, restaurants and all the fun stuff in the hotel. Since we had to wait for luggage we got some food. Service at restaurant was slow...but they are busy. Food and drinks were good.  Finally settled into our room and we find trash all over it...not good. We are now in our room...and just really weirded out. What else did they not clean? Not sure what to do as we have tonight and another night in this hotel that we had to pre pay for. Marriott....help??  Update! Now there is also a USED bar of soap in the shower!  Update 2. The facility is really awesome. ICE show was great. No help from hotel though...they are so busy I'm just a little fish in the pond. I updated a star for the entire facility. So....you get to pay over $300 to stay at a 5 star resort where no one tells you that all the restaurants are closed except one that is only offering a buffet of meatloaf and chicken! This is so unacceptable it's disgusting! How is this sanitary? I'm sitting in the lobby now and the manager is still no where to be found. The concierge is arguing and back peddling with my husband. He's asked for the manager and still nothing! Avoid at all cost! They have no transparency! They only want to take your money! Zero customer service! Stay elsewhere $32 parking charge just to visit the hotel is absolutely ridiculous and particularly during the slow months when the lots are basically empty.  Needless to say we didn't park or see the hotel and will never return again. Bar none, the worst customer service I have ever received. A room I had payed for a month in advance was unavailable, my debit card was charged 450$ in the first two hours for a 179$ room, I had to talk to three different managers in order to recover my funds, parking was an additional cost, the WiFi procedure was not explained and there was a general lack of concern. I actually overheard a member of the front desk staff say This woman is going to have to wait now because she got on my nerves\". Completely unacceptable. Giving more then 1 star because the resort isn't half bad but for $450/night I expected my hotel room to be CLEAN. This room was DISGUSTING. I was gone all day and just came back to my room to sleep, but in the morning I discovered women's hair all over the shower wall (I left my girlfriend at home) and there was an almond and debris on the floor next to the bed... the carpets look like they haven't been vacuumed in days. Really disappointed at the quality and standard of cleanliness this hotel maintains. The front desk staff I told at checkout was silent and had no response or apologies for my discomfort and dissatisfaction. I WILL NOT be staying here again. He who hesitates is lost. The facility is huge. The signage and maps are ridiculous. I was lost most of the time. I was not alone. By the end of the conference I was finally  able to find my room.     I should have used my GPS. We checked into the Grand Ole Opry because of the hurricane. Since Jim is an Elite member of Marriott we thought we would have a good experience. The first problem is they made a mistake and decided to give us points instead of cleaning the room. After that was settled we needed to stay because we can't go home due to the hurricane. They refused to give us an extension although they say if we pay $500 they can accommodate us. After we refuse this because legally they cannot through it so they are threatening to have security throw us out. Way to go Marriott. A lot of compassion there. The hotel is a beautiful experience, with gorgeous areas to walk though the expanse and botanical garden design of many walkways may present a hazard for many with walking difficulties.   The shuttles were the worst part of the experience.  The shuttle from the airport was late and then waited for several other passengers after an employee told him dejectedly there were a few more people. The bus driver was knowledgeable, and drove well to the hotel.  We had shuttles for the conference location which all had extended waits and were as or more expensive than ride share. The airport shuttle back was over 25 minutes late which resulted in nearly hour wait. Excessive cost for very poor delivery.  Transportation issues soured the entire experience. Nothing awful happened, but for the price and marketing of this place, I was expecting way more.  First off- the good. Pretty nice sized fitness center with a wide variety of equipment. The staff was also very friendly and helpful whenever I interacted.   The less than good: broken coffee maker in my room and a dinky, outdated hair dryer. My room wasn't super clean. I was also given a weird \"parlor room\" with a Murphy bed. The room was spacious, but the TV didn't face towards the bed even with adjustment. Last, and worst for me, the restaurants were extremely expensive for what you get. A tiny cup of miso soup was $6 and a small bowl of poké was $16. Not to mention $3.50 for Diet Pepsi. I don't understand how a family of 4 could feasibly stay here on any sort of budget with the pricing. The stay was great until the end. I was double charged for my room have had the charges removed and refunded 3 times and been charged again. One would think a multi-million dollar business could get it together and figure it out at least after the second time. This was a special weekend for me and my wife that was absolutely ruined. Will not stay there again and would not recommend to anyone else due to the incompetence. Service is very low. No one answers the operator call. Many technical issues with room keys and parking pass. Ladies and gentlemen I give you the Gaylord Opryland Hotel. I brought my wife and parents here hoping for a good time. As you can see from the photos we sat down to eat out burgers literally surrounded by garbage. There were employees walking through but not one picked up the garbage.  I don't know if this place is like this all the time but this was our experience. I will admit the rest of the grounds seemed maintained but there is no excuse to allow your customers to eat a meal surrounded by garbage and make absolutely no attempt to remove it. I doubt we will come back. Unbelievable ... had reservation months in advance, but when arrived from airport we were told they were full and we'd have to go to the Day's Inn. Then we were told that a room had been found with a sleeper sofa if that was okay. We agreed (I have give a talk at the conference here tomorrow), since we really need to get some sleep. Then we were told a room had \"opened up\" and they gave us the key. When we got to the room (nearly 2 a.m.) it was completely trashed (garbage, dirty linins and towels). I would post a picture, but I'm not seeing the option button at the moment. We let the front desk know, then they sent the maids. This place would not be my first choice. Completely disorganized, unprofessional. Unbelieveable. Hotel shuttle was a no show. If you need a ride to the airport just call uber  They expect you to wait outside in the cold and then tell you you must have not been there and that's why the shuttle didn't swing by the magnolia entrance  Bad end to an otherwise great stay.  Never imply that The fault is customers when you've they've been standing in he cold and now possibly late for flight!  Not my usual Marriott experience but called uber and they were there in 3 min Should have done that anyway This was my least favorite food in Nashville and overly priced. I came to see the Opry music show which was great but since it is way out there the only dinner options were in the hotel and it was not worth it. See the fountains but I'd say east somewhere else. This place has the worst service I have experienced in a long time.   The property is nice ,  but the staff are generally miserable.     Visited several restaurants and bars ,  pretty much ignored by bartenders.  The staff are mainly foreigners and immigrants and treat you rudely.    Pounding on the room door in the morning ,  repeatedly before 9 am ,  elevator didn't work. ,  $40 to part the car per night,  the cost of food and drinks is outrageous,  waiter spilled wine on my business guests wife at dinner ,   The whole experience smacks of a bad - cheap resort for people that don't know there are options it is run by people that know nothing of customer service.    Over crowded almost everywhere we went ,  and very expensive rooms.   Do yourself a favor and don't stay at the Opryland resort ! I was here for a conference. This place is expensive and not worth what you pay for. I guess you are paying for the name/popularity. The rooms are like an overpriced motel. This property is massive and it took over a day to learn my way around. I asked some of the hotel staff how to get from one place to another and at least 4 people did not speak English. However, the staff whom work near the meeting rooms spoke English. The room I stayed in was on the smaller.side. The room was barely \"cleaned\" after 4pm every day. Every day we had to request wash cloths, they would only leave hand towels. If I visit Nashville again, this will not be my go to place to stay. This was billed as a country Christmas  NOT Not family friendly  Drunks everywhere  Domestic violence brawl in the hallway at 230 in the morning  So over crowded you couldn't social distant  Lesson learned!! I stayed here as a weekend getaway.  They charge 20 dollars for self parking and it took me 20 minutes to get to my room since the place is so huge and confusing.  The rooms were ok but not worth the price.  I scheduled a massage at the spa and it was mediocre at best, so was the food. I will not be coming back. Place is a joke. Is beautiful on outside and in concourse. Rooms Are mediocre. Where they fall short.. half places are closed (even during huge conferences) restaurants are below par, everything is overpriced. Is far away from anything you would like to do unless you would like to see the grand ole opry. Save your money or buy stock in Advil This place is an amazing place to stay and walk around.    The rooms are ok nothing special but nice enough.    The hotel has almost 3000 rooms and only 3 restaurants open.  They do not have room service.    Hotel staff is nice but not helpful in making reservations or answering questions at all.    I would come back and enjoy my stay I would just make dinner plans elsewhere. It's a shame since the staff are  nice and the facility is 5 star grand that the way it is managed only warrants 2 stars. Already way to expensive. They charge a daily 20.00 extra cost for no reason what so ever. They charge 40.00 a day to park your car about ten feet from the front door. They charge extra for the water park. The views inside are great but the stained carpet in our room not so much. No daily room service unless you request it and they never tell you that. So many stores and restaurant closed. My opinion not worth the costs. I spend over 50% of each year in hotels, and I am the easiest guest to please. This property is horrible.  The biggest issue is that one can not talk to a human being via phone. Even when I press the correct number, per the automated attendant, to speak to hotel staff, I am told \"that is not a valid selection\".  This is a hotel, a resort hotel to be precise. Hospitality is there business. How in the world can they not answer a phone with a human being?  This is the second Gaylord wherein I've encountered this low level of client service this year.  With high-priced rates, Gaylord is definitely not worth it. Mega monster hotel. Very pretty decor, the atriums look great, fun stuff for kids and adults. However, service was a bit bellow par. The staff (refferred to the STARS) often did not even aknowledge guests in the hallways. RIP OFF they charged me $29 for a cheeseburger..did it come with fries? No it came with chips. For a burger that cost that much it should make it to my room within like 5 minutes...I'm still waiting. It said it would have tomato...it didn't. The man who brought it was great but the price is not okay. It was raining in the Murfreesboro/Franklin TN area, so we couldn't go sightseeing as we had planned. We hit the highway, and headed to the Gaylord Opryland Hotel in Nashville in order to see the gardens inside the hotel on our way back to MI.  Yes, it's worthwhile just to walk around inside this huge hotel just to see the plantings. We grabbed a map and charted a course that took us through nearly all the sections of this enormous place. We took a ton of photos, and had lunch there. There is a boat ride in the central section. Some gift shops along the way. Waterfalls and fountains. Orchids and bromeliads and all sorts of tall, exotic trees.  The $20 + tax for parking was mighty steep, but we did get several hours of entertainment for the five of us out of that one fee. As an Ambassador Titanium Bonvoy life member, I stay at many many Marriotts.  I reserved a stay and requested a suite upgrade which they confirmed I got via email.  Upon arrival, I was placed in a small old no balcony room far away from the lobby.  The staff were too busy to actually answer the phone or chat in a timely manner.  Front desk check in staff was rude and looked like she hated her job, the manager assured me he would send someone quickly to bring me new keys and it's been 15 minutes. Found pubes on the bathroom floor. Half the restaurant's and stores were closed. The food was pretty dang bad. For such a high cost it should be a lot better. The hotel is huge and has a beautiful atrium at the heart of it. The rooms decor is nice, but nothing over the top, or unexpected. The one huge problem I had with my room was that I could hear everyone in the halls just as if they were in my room. Horrible problem when you are trying to sleep and all you hear are people coughing, talking, and the pitter patter of their shoes shuffling across the carpet. Another disappointing feature of my room was the soiled pillow on my bed. This was very displeasing especially since they only gave me two pillows. Overall I'd rate my stay as fair. Very convenient if you plan on going the the Opry, but otherwise I would pass on this hotel. This hotel is like a ALL inclusive resort hotel. The large indoor atrium is beautiful & lush. In the evening it lights up with its Very on street lamps, restaurants & store fronts. It's YUGE! Like a indoor city. I hear that at Christmas they decorate it all up & it's very festive.   The sad part is that the rooms look like 10 miles of bad road in serious decline. The rooms on the first floor have been re-done bc of the past flooding a couple years ago but the upper rooms need a serious facelift.   We had a nice time at the hotel, the restaurants & bars were very good. However the rooms were no better than a best western.   Needs a serious update b4 I will return.   Cool place to visit, dine & have drinks. Rooms are in decline.\n"

Cynical, methinks. I prefer boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, and city hotels that have unique accomodations, one good restaurant, a coffee shop and a bar. Then, an inviting area to find dining, shopping (other than the usual suspect chains at Opry Mills).

My shower had a leak and the carpet was stained with large brown marks. Bed sheets were covered with random black powder. My room had a really sweet view of the loading bag.

My kids enjoyed the pool and exploring the enormous atriums.  I considered staying downtown or near Vanderbilt university and I wished I had.  The room was nice, clean and as expected for a typical Marriott but nothing more. The room was reasonably priced but everything else is extremely overpriced.

All and I mean all of the restaurants are mediocre. The food and the drinks are not exciting and below standard   $14 for vodka on the rocks which again looks like a thimble. The wait staff is hit or miss. They say there are pools but I am not walking all over to find them. If you are coming to Nashville why wouldn't you actually stay in Nashville. Except for a convention I would never ever stay at this hotel.\", \"Just a brutal experience. You are in the middle of nowhere. Unless you don't want to leave the property and pay crazy prices for everything...you're stuck.  WiFi is a pathetic joke. If you are paying 300 bucks a night. Yes, one overpriced meal; 20 dollars parking a night; and gas to get to anything off property and you are there. That much and you want me to pay for better WiFi? Ridiculous.\", 'If I could give 0 stars, or negative stars, I would. Went to the \"I love Christmas movies\" exhibit and it was the worst thing I\\'ve ever experienced in my life. It\\'s like they went into their attic and found anything they could to charge $30 per person to make an \"experience\". Half of the things didn\\'t work, the employees were embarrassed to be working there, and you stand in line for 2 hours before experiencing this laughable atrocity. Don\\'t waste your time or money.

Do not buy tickets to this dumpster fire.', \"The Gaylord Opryland is pretty nice. Nothing great. They nickel and dime you but that is no surprise for a resort. They lack clear signage upon arrival. It's a bit of a drive to the Nashville nightlife and prime activities. Overall it's a decent place but I was unimpressed for the price. I'd recommend staying downtown in the city for the same price\", \"So....you get to pay over $300 to stay at a 5 star resort where no one tells you that all the restaurants are closed except one that is only offering a buffet of meatloaf and chicken! This is so unacceptable it's disgusting! How is this sanitary? I'm sitting in the lobby now and the manager is still no where to be found. The concierge is arguing and back peddling with my husband. He's asked for the manager and still nothing! Avoid at all cost! They have no transparency! They only want to take your money! Zero customer service! Stay elsewhere\", \"$32 parking charge just to visit the hotel is absolutely ridiculous and particularly during the slow months when the lots are basically empty.  Needless to say we didn't park or see the hotel and will never return again.\", 'Bar none, the worst customer service I have ever received. A room I had payed for a month in advance was unavailable, my debit card was charged 450$ in the first two hours for a 179$ room, I had to talk to three different managers in order to recover my funds, parking was an additional cost, the WiFi procedure was not explained and there was a general lack of concern. I actually overheard a member of the front desk staff say This woman is going to have to wait now because she got on my nerves\". Completely unacceptable.', \"Giving more then 1 star because the resort isn't half bad but for $450/night I expected my hotel room to be CLEAN. This room was DISGUSTING. I was gone all day and just came back to my room to sleep, but in the morning I discovered women's hair all over the shower wall (I left my girlfriend at home) and there was an almond and debris on the floor next to the bed... the carpets look like they haven't been vacuumed in days.

Since Jim is an Elite member of Marriott we thought we would have a good experience. The first problem is they made a mistake and decided to give us points instead of cleaning the room. After that was settled we needed to stay because we can't go home due to the hurricane. They refused to give us an extension although they say if we pay $500 they can accommodate us. After we refuse this because legally they cannot through it so they are threatening to have security throw us out. Way to go Marriott. A lot of compassion there.\", 'The hotel is a beautiful experience, with gorgeous areas to walk though the expanse and botanical garden design of many walkways may present a hazard for many with walking difficulties.   The shuttles were the worst part of the experience.  The shuttle from the airport was late and then waited for several other passengers after an employee told him dejectedly there were a few more people. The bus driver was knowledgeable, and drove well to the hotel.  We had shuttles for the conference location which all had extended waits and were as or more expensive than ride share. The airport shuttle back was over 25 minutes late which resulted in nearly hour wait. Excessive cost for very poor delivery.  Transportation issues soured the entire experience.', 'The stay was great until the end. I was double charged for my room have had the charges removed and refunded 3 times and been charged again. One would think a multi-million dollar business could get it together and figure it out at least after the second time. This was a special weekend for me and my wife that was absolutely ruined.

Many technical issues with room keys and parking pass.', \"Ladies and gentlemen I give you the Gaylord Opryland Hotel. I brought my wife and parents here hoping for a good time. As you can see from the photos we sat down to eat out burgers literally surrounded by garbage. There were employees walking through but not one picked up the garbage.  I don't know if this place is like this all the time but this was our experience. I will admit the rest of the grounds seemed maintained but there is no excuse to allow your customers to eat a meal surrounded by garbage and make absolutely no attempt to remove it. I doubt we will come back.\", 'Unbelievable ... had reservation months in advance, but when arrived from airport we were told they were full and we\\'d have to go to the Day\\'s Inn. Then we were told that a room had been found with a sleeper sofa if that was okay. We agreed (I have give a talk at the conference here tomorrow), since we really need to get some sleep. Then we were told a room had \"opened up\" and they gave us the key. When we got to the room (nearly 2 a.m.) it was completely trashed (garbage, dirty linins and towels). I would post a picture, but I\\'m not seeing the option button at the moment. We let the front desk know, then they sent the maids. This place would not be my first choice. Completely disorganized, unprofessional. Unbelieveable.', \"Hotel shuttle was a no show.

I came to see the Opry music show which was great but since it is way out there the only dinner options were in the hotel and it was not worth it. See the fountains but I'd say east somewhere else.\", \"This place has the worst service I have experienced in a long time.   The property is nice ,  but the staff are generally miserable.

The staff are mainly foreigners and immigrants and treat you rudely.  \\n\\nPounding on the room door in the morning ,  repeatedly before 9 am ,  elevator didn't work. ,  $40 to part the car per night,  the cost of food and drinks is outrageous,  waiter spilled wine on my business guests wife at dinner ,   The whole experience smacks of a bad - cheap resort for people that don't know there are options it is run by people that know nothing of customer service.  \\n\\nOver crowded almost everywhere we went ,  and very expensive rooms.   Do yourself a favor and don't stay at the Opryland resort !\", 'I was here for a conference. This place is expensive and not worth what you pay for. I guess you are paying for the name/popularity. The rooms are like an overpriced motel. This property is massive and it took over a day to learn my way around. I asked some of the hotel staff how to get from one place to another and at least 4 people did not speak English. However, the staff whom work near the meeting rooms spoke English. The room I stayed in was on the smaller.side. The room was barely \"cleaned\" after 4pm every day. Every day we had to request wash cloths, they would only leave hand towels.

They charge 20 dollars for self parking and it took me 20 minutes to get to my room since the place is so huge and confusing.  The rooms were ok but not worth the price.

I will not be coming back.', 'This place is an amazing place to stay and walk around.  \\n\\nThe rooms are ok nothing special but nice enough.  \\n\\nThe hotel has almost 3000 rooms and only 3 restaurants open.  They do not have room service.  \\n\\nHotel staff is nice but not helpful in making reservations or answering questions at all.  \\n\\nI would come back and enjoy my stay I would just make dinner plans elsewhere.', \"It's a shame since the staff are  nice and the facility is 5 star grand that the way it is managed only warrants 2 stars.\", 'Already way to expensive. They charge a daily 20.00 extra cost for no reason what so ever. They charge 40.00 a day to park your car about ten feet from the front door. They charge extra for the water park. The views inside are great but the stained carpet in our room not so much. No daily room service unless you request it and they never tell you that. So many stores and restaurant closed. My opinion not worth the costs.', 'I spend over 50% of each year in hotels, and I am the easiest guest to please. This property is horrible.  The biggest issue is that one can not talk to a human being via phone. Even when I press the correct number, per the automated attendant, to speak to hotel staff, I am told \"that is not a valid selection\".\\n\\nThis is a hotel, a resort hotel to be precise. Hospitality is there business. How in the world can they not answer a phone with a human being?  This is the second Gaylord wherein I\\'ve encountered this low level of client service this year.  With high-priced rates, Gaylord is definitely not worth it.', \"RIP OFF they charged me $29 for a cheeseburger..did it come with fries? No it came with chips. For a burger that cost that much it should make it to my room within like 5 minutes...I'm still waiting. It said it would have tomato...it didn't. The man who brought it was great but the price is not okay.\", \"As an Ambassador Titanium Bonvoy life member, I stay at many many Marriotts.  I reserved a stay and requested a suite upgrade which they confirmed I got via email.  Upon arrival, I was placed in a small old no balcony room far away from the lobby.

Front desk check in staff was rude and looked like she hated her job, the manager assured me he would send someone quickly to bring me new keys and it's been 15 minutes.\", \"Found pubes on the bathroom floor. Half the restaurant's and stores were closed. The food was pretty dang bad. For such a high cost it should be a lot better.\", \"The hotel is huge and has a beautiful atrium at the heart of it. The rooms decor is nice, but nothing over the top, or unexpected. The one huge problem\\nI had with my room was that I could hear everyone in the halls just as if they were in my room. Horrible problem when you are trying to sleep and all you hear are people coughing, talking, and the pitter patter of their shoes shuffling across the carpet. Another disappointing feature of my room was the soiled pillow on my bed. This was very displeasing especially since they only gave me two pillows. Overall I'd rate my stay as fair. Very convenient if you plan on going the the Opry, but otherwise I would pass on this hotel.\"]\n"

Now the rooms in the hotel are not worth paying to stay in one of them. It's too expansive for just a simple old room, not worth it at all !!! It has a mini fridge, a small safe box but no microwave inside the room (you can find one by some areas where the elevators are located).\", 'In total agreement that this is just like a Las Vegas Strip hotel...HUGE, EXPENSIVE, but it is also clean, beautiful, and lots to see and do.  I recommend packing a big, rolling suitcase full of food and beverage to take to your hotel room, (and it will be a HIKE!) but it will save you mega bucks.  You will pay $8.00 for a Bud Light here.)

Yes, they have fake waterfalls and real plants inside, but it's so crowded, it's HUGE (literally could take 20 mins to get to your room), the food is disgusting, and you can hear everything at all hours. If you really enjoy vegas hotels, this is your place - lots to do if you never want to leave the hotel (which is odd to me). If you like exploring the city, good food, and a good night sleep, I'd splurge on a place downtown, or anywhere that isn't this hotel.\", \"The place is straight out of an Escher etching.

How gay is that?\", \"Ok,  my initial disappointment has been  somewhat eliviated, but the Opryland Resort is still lacking a world-class resort feel.  Perhaps it's the purpose and theme of the hotel.  There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping. \\n\\nThe restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not. \\n\\nFinally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.   \\n\\nAs a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done.\", 'What a mistake staying here.  First off, I know it is a giant place and all that, which was neat to see and experience.  You have to travel a bit to get to your room, which involves waiting for very slow elevators each time.

The biggest downside is the fact that the hotel is very business-centric in the sense that everything is monetized and pretty expensive. The restaurants in the hotel are great, but expensive. The room service is really good, but really expensive. You can tell that the biggest feature of this hotel is the hotel itself. The atrium rooms are amazing, but wondering if it was worth the premium we paid for them. Seeing as we paid more for a room here than we would have in New York City, I wish they were a little bigger.

It's absolutely beautiful and relaxing. However, you are pretty much stuck there for meals. The hotel is massive and there just aren't enough facilities for lunch and breakfast. The pool is way too small but they are fixing that soon. It gets old waiting in a one hour line for breakfast and lunch. There are long lines at the convenience stores and just about anywhere you can get food. That being said, we love it and will be back. Great staycation for a weekend.\", 'Terrible service. Check in was delayed by 2 hours. Took an hour to get the car out of valet after being told it would be 15 mins. Missed most of a dinner date with friends because of it. Rooms are outdated for the price and we were in the \"nice\" area. Normally when traveling for pleasure I like to stay at a W or Westin. This was of lesser quality for a higher price than the hamptons I stay in for work.

There are several on-site restaurants, spa treatments, and fitness activities available for hotel guests.  I particularly enjoyed the atrium view, as you can some of the suite's balconies, and an expansive enclosed area with a tropical weather, allowing palm trees and other topical plants to flourish.  There are water fountains and a stream, weaving throughout the atrium area.  Great place to soak in the views.  There are also rooms available to rent and to utilize for conferences and/or meetings.  Starbucks coffee dispensers are also upstairs where you use your card to get a cup of joe.  Parking is limited and can be very price if you're park on-site; however, you can park in the mall area and just walk across!\\n\\n+atrium view\", \"I understand the appeal, but not my cup of tea. Was here over the weekend since my boyfriend had a room for a work event the following week. Very crowded and very manufactured, like all of the Gaylord resorts. If you've never been, it's a cross between a Disney world resort and a wannabe Vegas resort. The hotel common areas are very pretty, with lots of foliage and greenery throughout the atrium, but the rooms were just okay and a little outdated.\", \"Honestly, I'm severely underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong the hotel is huge, entertaining and with beautiful atriums and many walkways but it's insanely overpriced! Everything is. The rooms. The food. The drinks.\\n\\nIt's not worth the price for the size of the rooms and the service.\\n\\nI'd recommend getting a cheaper place and going to the various attractions around town.\", \"Only writing a review for walking around inside not staying at resort. Most importantly DO NOT PAY $24 to park. If you are just walking around for a few hours park in the mall parking lot next store- short walk to one of the entrances. It was OK to spend an hour. Fountain is really cool and it is amazing how big it is inside- got to take a lot of AC in August that's for sure.\", \"If you are interested in overeating and waiting in long lines to do it, this is the place for you!  Obviously I am joking but they cater to a specific crowd -- older, heavy, and out of shape.  There are not many healthy dining options but, on the positive side, you will have the gym and spa to yourself.  The hotel rooms are dated but functional.  High-speed internet access is spotty and that is particularly strange for a place that caters to business meetings.  If you have to go there because of a conference, make the best of it.  But I wouldn't choose to go.\", \"Opryland Resort was listed as a top thing to do in Nashville so we decided to go. I had heard that the grounds were beautiful and they are nice. There are 50,000 plants of 500 different species. But it's really just a big hotel. Parking is $24. Some of the restaurants will validate so if you eat at one of them the parking will be free.  Most the restaurants had a wait time and seem a little pricey. We ate at the sports bar. Food disappointing and service slow. With all of the entertainment along Broadway, I thought there would be entertainment in several areas with a place this large but we didn't see any. Unless you like walking around a really big hotel, I would pass on Opryland as a must do while in Nashville.\", \"Beautiful resort.\\n\\nReally nicely decorated rooms with great beds.  Horrible pillows. Great towels and toiletries.

The place was huge! And parking, oh don't even get me started on that! The parking lot itself is a huge maze! The food was subpar, nothing like I would have expected from the Gaylord. The tropical plants were cool to look at, but it all felt very cheesy and overdone. The waiters were very nice. The only good thing about the dinner was the peach cobbler! I ate three little servings of that and I'm not a big fan of peach. I had to add some sugar to it but it was really good. That's the only reason why this place gets a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating.\", \"From the outside you may think you are going to be walking into the must see place in Nashville but just like most tourist traps this one turned out to be just OK.  This is not a must see place in Nashville so if you have limited time mosey your way past this place.  The hotel is huge and it looks like you are in a theme park.  I really think the reason why there is so many people walking around is because they all can't find their rooms.  \\n\\nSo if you have extra time...check the place out.  Food is very overpriced and there really isn't that much to see but it is an OK way to spend an hour or two.\", 'Gave two stars because of the appearance of the hotel.. It is amazing.

This place is huge and it is quite easy to get lost in it.  Having been to the other location in Orlando, I can say that I prefer this location.  The staff are extremely helpful and nice, and the food choices, although priced for a resort, are plentiful.  Going for a convention is great, as you really don't need to go out for much if you don't want to.  It is within walking distance to the Opry Mills mall, the Grand Ole Opry (they also have a free shuttle there), and they have a shuttle to downtown Nashville for a nominal fee (much less than taxi).\", \"Very cool at first glance.. huge and I mean HUGE layout. The different atriums are pretty sweet to walk through and check out. However, it's overwhelming. The simplest of tasks are instantly difficult to accomplish due to the fact that this place is massive and takes about 2-3 solid days of navigating to grasp. Need to head out to your vehicle because you forgot an item... that's a 20min ordeal. \\n\\nThe rooms aren't anything special, I'm easy to please, but for the price of this place the rooms could use some TLC. \\n\\nNot a bad place to stay, just huge and overly complicated for me.

At least they don't have a coin meter on the toilets (yet).  Oh, but beautiful facility.  It really is.\", 'The resort is beautiful and centrally located.  As a new visitor to Nashville it was easy to get to all the tourist attractions. We were charged for every additional service that you would normally expect to be included (WiFi etc), but the service workers tips are not included, so be careful what you get and be sure to tip cash. Room service is overpriced but the food is outstanding. There are free places to park, which I recommend and just use the shuttle.', \"Sorry but the place has changed for the worse.  I have been fortunate enough to stay at all the Gaylord's, Orlando, Washington, Dallas, and here in Nashville  more than a few times over the years for business.

Mediocre food at insane prices.  Skeleton staff.  Most of the nicer restaurants are not open every day. Room service add 20% PLUS a delivery fee. Sad because this was once a great place. Staff attitude is also very dry.  Seems they just want the day to end so they can go home.  Much better options for what they charge.\", 'Besides the amazing decor in the hotel and the fact that this place is like a mini disneyland, everything else is mediocre.

We were disappointed with that, but the room was clean with a comfortable pillowtop mattress.  Check in was prompt.  No problems with rude employees like several of the comments on here.  Be prepared to walk, walk, and walk some more.  The mexican restaurant on the property is the worst mexican food I have ever tried.

I have to give you credit for your employees who drop everything to show you to your room....IF they are around. Big turnoff and unless you change this flaw will never stay again. While on the subject, time to upgrade your rooms you are nothing better than a regular medium range chain..sorry.', 'The service and food do not match the beautiful facility. Everything was very clean. The majority of our interactions with the staff were okay, nothing great but a few less than great. The resort was full during our stay and many of the restaurants were closed during meal times. On Monday, the pool Café was open for lunch, when we went on Tuesday, at the same time, it was closed.

There\\'s a fake waterfall and river that wooden boats float down at all hours of the day. You can\\'t get more cheese than that.\\n\\n2) The restaurants in the \"village\" are terrible.

Staff was helpful when they could be found but the place was so large it could be hard to find help when lost!\", 'Can we say \"massive\"?! It\\'s just a huge place in terms of the number of rooms to the size of atrium with waterfalls and running creeks, etc. It feels like you are in a botanical garden as you enter the hotel. However, I was not too impressed with our room. It was nice, but it wasn\\'t great. I had better rooms in less expensive business hotels. Service was good. Restaurants in the hotels were OK. Probably the best deal I had was a decent breakfast for $20 or so. Service tends to be slow since they are always busy with guests. Massive hotel+huge number of guests+limited number of restaurants=slow service. If you are here for Grand Ole Opry House, it is in a walking distance. So it makes it very convenient. There\\'s also a decent size shopping mall with many chain restaurants. That might be a better option for meals.', 'The indoor pool was dirty, but the place it self was awesome! The canopies are grate and the service is good.', \"Glad I didn't have to pay for this as I stayed here on business to attend a convention.  It's ok, kind of meh though.  Feels like they are very content to nickel, dime and generally overcharge their customers.  I mean $33 for greasy fish and chips and pint is a bit extreme.  Seems to be all about style/appearances rather than actual substance.  The saving grace were the staff that I interacted with as they were pleasant, polite and friendly.  Would I stay there on my own dime?  Nope, not a chance.\", 'Breakfast with Shrek, Princess Fiona and Puss n Boots!!!  Best breakfast ever!   The traffic, parking and waiting situation was dreadful.  Make sure you give yourself a minimum hour and a half for travel coming from 2 exits up.  Once we finally got on the property, we had to park so far away and there was no shuttle so we had to walk a very long way in the freezing cold.  Apparently this is normal.  Maybe they could figure out a way to make the experience better.  Once inside, there were no maps to where we need to be.

The rooms are well kept, quiet and have excellent black out curtains.  However, I wouldn't pay to stay or patronize any of the Gaylord's extremely overpriced and underwhelming restaurants.  I only went to the Gaylord Opryland in the first place for a conference that my company paid for.\\n\\nIf you do intend to stay here, I highly recommend any restaurant outside the Gaylord.  The Cracker Barrel across the street had significantly better food in my opinion and I'm not a Cracker Barrel fan by any means.\\n\\nIn short, it's a very nice and expensive tourist trap.\", \"This is a Gaylord property and therefore is all that goes with being Gaylord - expansive views under glass with a confusing layout and lots of walking.

My lunch at Sports Bar was 120.00 dollars. The food was marginal at best. The service was excellent. However the food is lacking.', \"They pack this place with so many people you can't even walk around to enjoy that the grounds are nice.  Forget about getting into restaurants or even talking with the front desk, it won't happen without a 20 minute wait. Clearly, they have not staffed accordingly and people that are working are scrambling. We have waited to get into everything, including just using the bathroom in the front lobby area. Trams to parking that cost $20 were not running and my father that needs assistance walking didn't not receive help even after we called 3 times. Do not waste your money here. There are plenty of ways to enjoy the city without this nightmare.\", 'We came for a Christmas getaway. While the hotel and Christmas atmosphere was nice, the check in process took over an hour. We were given an upgrade from our suite and were excited as we carried our luggage about 5 miles through a maze of endless hallway after hallway to a room roughly the size of a walk in closet with a breath taking view of a service parking lot and shed.\\nAfter we found our way back to the lobby I was told the closet we were given as a room was much better than the suite with an atrium view that I had reserved. They did give us the room that I had originally booked and our stay has been nice since.\\nCrowds are amazingly large and as in most places, common courtesy is a rarity. All in all... not a bad little getaway.', \"We stayed three nights here. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.

Sushi. Steak. Tacos. Pizza. Salad. Beer. Wine. Tennessee Whiskey. We dined at 2 restaurants over the course of our stay, but we found yummier items outside of the resort. \\nOur room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. \\nConcierge is great for helping you get downtown. Purchase tickets in groups of 4 or more and they are only $10. Don't have 4 in your group? No problem. Buy with 2 other people in line waiting to buy tix... make friends, save money. \\nThe resort is surely beautiful. Well kept and welcoming.\", \"Sure the place is beautiful but they treat everyone like we are walking ATM machines and endless supplying piggy banks. The staff doesn't care about the people or our experience (and they make that painfully aware), they all just look for the next opportunity to get the cash out of your pockets. They built this place as somewhere you don't have to leave for the duration of your trip but make it impossible to afford to be in there. This place is great for being at a conference when the company pays for everything but aside from that, it isn't worth the money. Stay somewhere else and MAYBE (you'll be totally fine if you never see this place, I promise) make a small trip to walk through... bring your wallet though because no one will help you unless you have cash taped to your forehead.\", \"Nice property with possibilities. Staff is where it breaks down. A lack of training is evident from the honors registration to the concierge. No real effort to focus on the customer. Be prepared to know which atrium best meets your preference. \\n\\nRestaurants weren't much better. Staff had a routine for seating which meant we were dircted to a table in nowhereland even though the restaurant had just opened and there  wasn't a  crowd. As a resort there should be more focus on understanding and helping the customer enjoy the very nice facility.\", \"Always a beautiful place to stay!! Bellman was nice and explanatory about the room and amenities. Room was very comfortable. When we called to checkout, the lady at the front desk advised that in order to obtain the valet'd car, I was advised they had plenty of staff and just take the ticket outside. Upon arrival outside at the desk, we were advised we needed to go inside to a different desk. The interesting part was that there were half a dozen workers standing 3 feet from us hanging out and talking as I walked in to retrieve my own keys (picture attached). That killed the $400 per night charge plus $30 valet parking fee for me. I would prefer to stay downtown closer to Broadway and the concert venues there. If you like shopping however the Opry Mills Mall is next door to the Gaylord. Great shopping and restaurants.\", 'This hotel/resort reminded me of las vegas without the gambling, and night clubs.  It is huge and literally took me about 15 minutes to get to my room from the lobby.  While it seems like there is a lot going on, there is not much worth doing in the place.  The restaurants are not great and the shopping was not impressive.  You can do a riverboat ride inside the hotel which seemed kind of pointless.\\nThe rooms were clean, spacious and nice.  They give you a free water bottle which was a huge plus.  Hate when they charge you 5 dollars for water at other hotels.  The staff was friendly.  The check out process was quick.  Really appreciated the express check out option.  The place is quite pricey and may not really be worth it.', 'This place is huge!  The scenery inside is absolutely fantastic. I was impressed with the man-made river and all the live plants. They even have a neat boat ride.\\n\\nMy hotel room was in the delta section and it was alright; however, the AC had a very, very hard time trying to keep the room cool enough.

But other than that, the place is amazing. Huge, well maintained indoor gardens, boat rides, waterfalls, etc... It's a must see when visiting the city. Just once.\", \"No denying that this place has charm and is gorgeous. I just have major beef with the over priced parking, the food service that ends at midnight and the fact that after you have already spent an arm and leg, they can't even offer a continental breakfast.  I paid $80 for the Fiddler's Inn across the street and they had complimentary breakfast so don't tell me this place can't swing it. They wouldn't even bring Advil to the room for my friend who was suffering from a headache. They told her that rather than spare a couple pills to a guest, she could go pay top dollar for it in the gift shop. Save your money unless this is just a super special getaway.\", \"This place is HUGE and the only reason I can think to stay here is because you're attending a conference.  Seriously, it makes no sense to vacation at a place like this because you could stay inside all day and really it wouldn't matter what town you're in.  Rooms were fine and comfortable.  If you do have to be stuck at a conference for a week, it's nice to feel like you're outside, I guess.  \\nThere are a ton of restaurants on sight.

We went here for the day while visiting family to get out of the heat since we had a newborn baby with us. The inside atmosphere of this hotel is incredible. Took the boat tour first to get a history in the place. Was really expensive $10/person for a 10 minute boat ride, but it did let us see the entire hotel quickly.

They don't even have complimentary tooth paste, toothbrush,slippers, etc.  Only shampoo, conditioner, lotion , shower gel and soap good for one person. The room we got on the first night was facing exterior view and oh boy, it was so noisy because of the construction going on so I requested for a change of room. Good thing they transferred us.

The rooms are costly for ~200/day and the hotel to airport shuttle cost ~30/roundtrip. Other hotels have a free shuttle to their hotel.

They have a bus to take you downtown but it's 20 dollars a day and runs only one time per hour.

If it weren't so frustrating it would have been comedic. And while it dampened our family's get together, we weren't alone. Many hotel guest were sharing similar stories. Expect to spend multiple hours standing in line to register. Certainly not up to the Marriott brand. They refer to it as a spa property but much more zoo like -definitely not relaxing.\", 'After a wonderful Christmas celebration at our son\\'s home, we stayed the night at Gaylord Opryland before driving home.\\n\\nThe property is lovely and we looked forward to staying here to enjoy the facility and the decorations.\\n\\nShortly after 7 AM on December 26, we were rudely awakened by the noise of trucks, hammers and workers shouting! Our room was located directly beside an ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION SITE!!!!  Is this the reason for the \"resort fee\" charge??? \\n\\nThis hotel is massive so why was our room literally on top of the construction site for a new water park? Why weren\\'t we told that when we checked in???? \\n\\nI can\\'t describe how disappointed we were!! \\n\\nBEWARE if you stay here!!!', 'Tip: if you are not staying at the hotel and just want to walk around and experience it (like my boyfriend and I did) DO NOT park on the grounds... Parking is $25! My boyfriend and I parked in the hotel/restaurant parking lot across the street for free. About an 8 minute walk to get to the entrance... Definitely worth saving the money. The hotel was nice, but I would have been upset if I had spent $25 just to walk around...\\n\\nAlso, across the street is the Dukes of Hazard museum (free admission)!', 'This is NOT the Nashville you know, knew or is. Hopefully, NOT what Nashville is becoming. To sum it up in one word: CONFUSING. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. And then they argue when it\\'s brought to their attention. Overall...it\\'s still a nice place...but it\\'s more of a 2 star hotel when it comes to basics. My advice? Stay in the local hotels and then hop over to take pics if you want pretty pics. Nashville has so much to offer, and this \"new\" Opryland puts a bad face on this wonderful city.', \"Visited back in December 2010, had an overall good experience. The resort is great- very clean, updated rooms, comfortable beds, good gym and spa, friendly/helpful staff, my room had a great view of all the 'A Country Christmas' stuff which was plus! \\n\\nOnly complaint is the lack of variety in food establishments it's mostly sit-down restaurants w/ wait time of ~35-60mins (lunch/dinner time), being that I was there for a work conference and there were several conferences taking place as well this made lunch time a hassle.\", 'Once again this resort is not able to handle a huge conference. Inadequate food, beverage stops along the way. Yogurt shop open 2-9pm is one small example. Lines 20-30 people long to go to restroom and get coffee. No places to get snacks in between a ten hour conference day. Restaurants when open, are good, yet when the resort is full good luck eating on the run. Food trucks, pop-up vendors would be awesome.', \"To say that this much anticipated stay was a disappointment would be a HUGE understatement.  When I think Gaylord, I think elegance, I think great customer service, I think excellent restaurant choices, I think lush bedding/towels, I think friendly, happy service.  My husband and I found NONE of this.  Your staff (other than the gentleman who checked us in) was awful!  We did not come across one friendly employee/staff member.  Your restaurant selection is poor, way overpriced with very unfriendly staff and mediocre at best food!  The entire facility was FREEZING cold and smelled like chlorine.  The Gaylord is dated and in need of renovations.  The only bright spot was that the plants/trees/lighting is beautiful and that it is so convenient to Opryland... that's it.  ONCE AND DONE!!!!!!!!!!!  Expected much more.  Marriott should be questioning their investment.\", \"The hotel itself is beautiful! The spa is great and there are a ton of options for restaurants and bars. The rooms are very basic. You would expect much more when you see the lobby. My main frustration was there needs to be more staff available to help people get to and from. The hotel is huge. Everyone walks around lost. It could of been a 4 or 5 star stay if I wasn't so stressed about finding where I was trying to go.\", \"Not bad- overall it's HUGE like a little city. Reminds me of the Bellagio in Vegas. There is a lot to do here and  a host of choices for food. Stayed for three nights and didn't leave the property except to go to Publix and the mall. \\n\\nFood is pricy and drinks even more but if you don't want to head off site - it's tolerable. \\n\\nMy bed was sub-par and squeaky. Bathroom nice and overall the room was updated. There was a small fridge and coffee maker in the room. My room was a standard and nothing special. \\n\\nOf course there are coffee shops and little stores and you can get whatever you need. Gelato and yogurt onsite as well. \\n\\nWould I purposefully stay again? Probably not- too big for me. I like small, quaint and personal. This was not the case. \\n\\nOk hotel but probably won't be back.\", \"Nope.  Just nope.\\n\\nDon't care how nice it is-- the pricing is super deceptive.\\n\\nBooked this resort on Priceline thinking it was a good deal -- SURPRISE, it's $50 more thanks to $26 parking (whhaat??  it's not even downtown, there is plenty of parking) and a $20 resort fee (not optional).\\n\\nThat's ridiculous.  If you need to charge that much, bake it into the room price.\", \"Fees...\\nYes the place is awesome. It looks amazing. It's as good as anything Disney has. A boat ride and an area that looks like New Orleans. But when I was sold a nightly price of $169, then paid $252, I'm trying to figure out how over eighty dollars in fees is possible. Well it's beautiful regardless.\", \"I thought it was very nice. Beautiful inside. Just gorgeous. Lots of nice restaurants. However, I found the rooms to be a bit pricey, and the hotel itself too big. It's huge! My girlfriend and I got lost so many times over the four days of staying there. Lost trying to find our room, or maneuver our way around the premises. My next problem is the room we stayed in, we could hear every passerby in the hallway. We did not use the pools or the water park, because we spent our days sightseeing all around Nashville. But the hotel is very beautiful I will say.\", \"Wow. Giant tourist trap.  Stay down town and party.\\nRestaurants are so so 2-3 stars tops.  Odd so many servers are from another country being where it is.  Rooms are small and feel really old even though it's not that old.  The gardens are amazing.  If your going to the opry good for a night.\", \"It's a beautiful hotel. But getting nickel'd and dime'd to death after spending $300 on a room gets tiresome. \\n\\n$29/day for parking is excessive by at least $10\\n$20/day resort fee on our final bill?\\n\\nBe honest with your pricing and include the resort fee in your rate. \\n\\nYou can park in the attached mall lot and save $29. We wish we did.\", 'Place is pretty but very artificial. We love the tropics and all the flowers but all we smelled was chlorine when we walked thru the atrium. Just not our style.', 'Beautiful to walk around in, and just massive.  Parking can be a hassle (and $20) but still a fun place to bring folks from out of town to visit.  Eating in side is quite pricey, but fun for a special occasion.', \"This place is huge with a lot to see. We didn't stay here, but I would like to in the future. The rooms looked nice. We walked around and took the boat ride. The boat ride wasn't worth $10, but it made a few in the group happy to do it. They had all the lights up for the holidays already. It was very pretty on the inside. The place offered shopping and restaurants. Unless I plan on booking a hotel room there, I probably won't be back for a while. In my opinion, it's good to see it once.\", \"I was here during Christmas time and they really do a nice job of adding a lot of holiday fun, decorations and add in Santa being available for kids.  This is a nice space and I really found it far more pleasant than the Gaylord Resort at National Harbor I had recently visited prior to this one.  This is also located at the famous Grand Ole Oprey and right next to a large shopping mall (pro tip: you can park at the mall for free then take a free shuttle bus to the Convention Center).  This is a very large space with a great deal to see so make sure to schedule a pretty large chunk of time to fully explore this space.  The convention center is also very nice and this is one of the best places to attend a conference that I've ever experienced.\", \"So the hotel is pretty great, and the whole area has so many amenities and has such a nice warm emulated outside environment. It's great. I could go on forever on what there is to do and explore in here.\\n\\nYet I still cant get over the literal 45 minute wait I had to CHECK IN. This isn't acceptable in the slightest, ever.\\n\\nAlso, the hot water, or lack thereof, was terrible. It kept going on and off.\\n\\nAnd there is a non-negotiable 20 dollar resort fee? Gotta love hidden fees.\", \"The grounds of the resort truly make the stay. Several pool and restaurant options are available. They also have a large convention space for meetings. The rooms are well appointed and I had a nice balcony overlooking the Cascades area. My number one complaint, and I have stayed a resorts before, is the pricing. Can you imagine needing a razor and it is $18.99? For a disposable Venus? 300% markup! Wow, good thing I didn't cut myself. I might have needed another $20 for band-aids.\", \"Pretty & massive, it's easy to get lost & everything is overpriced. While it seemed fun for many guests, my room had a strong chemical smell because they had recently refinished the bathtub. There were many renovations going on so there was an odd odor during my whole stay.\\n\\nI was there for work, so I'm not sure of the costs of the room. It was ornate & just not my taste. However the pool looked like fun & the beds were super comfortable.\\n\\nI wouldn't turn down another opportunity to stay there, but if I were paying I would be more critical.\", \"We spent the weekend at the resort while attending a conference. While the gardens were simply amazing, the rooms themselves were somewhat subpar and front desk staff were downright rude and unprofessional. This shouldn't happen at any resort.\\nDuring the weekend we had the chance to try several of the restaurants inside the resort and they were fantastic but very expensive. The best that we found was a simple pizzeria in the delta atrium that we couldn't figure out why it was closed for three of four lunchtimes over the period of the weekend. \\nKids loved the pools but found little to do for families except the gardens and pools. We watched several movies in the room or had to travel off site for attractions.\", \"This place sucks!!!!! Nothing but problems since we got here, be prepared to wait for more than 20 minutes when calling the front desk. Tried to order room service only to be told that they were busy and it was an inconvenience for them to bring us food. The place is a maze and has very little considering how big it is and how much it's advertised. The entire center of the place is closed right now for a conference and only a few restaurants are open but all have more than an hour wait. Trying to get any where else in Nashville is at least a 20 minute drive. I will never again waste over $300 a night here, Renaissance and Omni are way better choices!\", \"Stay at Marriott hotels all over...so had to try this one in Nashville. Check out ice, restaurants and all the fun stuff in the hotel. Since we had to wait for luggage we got some food. Service at restaurant was slow...but they are busy. Food and drinks were good. \\nFinally settled into our room and we find trash all over it...not good. We are now in our room...and just really weirded out. What else did they not clean? Not sure what to do as we have tonight and another night in this hotel that we had to pre pay for. Marriott....help??\\n\\nUpdate! Now there is also a USED bar of soap in the shower!\\n\\nUpdate 2. The facility is really awesome. ICE show was great. No help from hotel though...they are so busy I'm just a little fish in the pond. I updated a star for the entire facility.\", 'Nothing awful happened, but for the price and marketing of this place, I was expecting way more.\\n\\nFirst off- the good. Pretty nice sized fitness center with a wide variety of equipment. The staff was also very friendly and helpful whenever I interacted. \\n\\nThe less than good: broken coffee maker in my room and a dinky, outdated hair dryer. My room wasn\\'t super clean. I was also given a weird \"parlor room\" with a Murphy bed. The room was spacious, but the TV didn\\'t face towards the bed even with adjustment. Last, and worst for me, the restaurants were extremely expensive for what you get. A tiny cup of miso soup was $6 and a small bowl of poké was $16. Not to mention $3.50 for Diet Pepsi. I don\\'t understand how a family of 4 could feasibly stay here on any sort of budget with the pricing.', 'Place is a joke. Is beautiful on outside and in concourse. Rooms Are mediocre. Where they fall short.. half places are closed (even during huge conferences) restaurants are below par, everything is overpriced. Is far away from anything you would like to do unless you would like to see the grand ole opry. Save your money or buy stock in\\nAdvil', 'Mega monster hotel. Very pretty decor, the atriums look great, fun stuff for kids and adults. However, service was a bit bellow par. The staff (refferred to the STARS) often did not even aknowledge guests in the hallways.', \"It was raining in the Murfreesboro/Franklin TN area, so we couldn't go sightseeing as we had planned. We hit the highway, and headed to the Gaylord Opryland Hotel in Nashville in order to see the gardens inside the hotel on our way back to MI.\\n\\nYes, it's worthwhile just to walk around inside this huge hotel just to see the plantings. We grabbed a map and charted a course that took us through nearly all the sections of this enormous place. We took a ton of photos, and had lunch there. There is a boat ride in the central section. Some gift shops along the way. Waterfalls and fountains. Orchids and bromeliads and all sorts of tall, exotic trees.\\n\\nThe $20 + tax for parking was mighty steep, but we did get several hours of entertainment for the five of us out of that one fee.\", \"This hotel is like a ALL inclusive resort hotel. The large indoor atrium is beautiful & lush. In the evening it lights up with its Very on street lamps, restaurants & store fronts. It's YUGE! Like a indoor city. I hear that at Christmas they decorate it all up & it's very festive. \\n\\nThe sad part is that the rooms look like 10 miles of bad road in serious decline. The rooms on the first floor have been re-done bc of the past flooding a couple years ago but the upper rooms need a serious facelift. \\n\\nWe had a nice time at the hotel, the restaurants & bars were very good. However the rooms were no better than a best western. \\n\\nNeeds a serious update b4 I will return. \\n\\nCool place to visit, dine & have drinks. Rooms are in decline.\"]\n"
